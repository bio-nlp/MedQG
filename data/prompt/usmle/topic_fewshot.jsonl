{"clinical_note":"A 36-year-old G4P2 premenopausal woman with a family history of colorectal, hepatobiliary cancers felt an abnormal right breast lump. Diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound showed a hypoechoic lesion in the upper outer quadrant of right breast measuring 14 mm x 13 mm x 18 mm and 5 x 4 mm satellite lesion is noted 6 mm inferior to the dominant mass, BI-RADS 5 highly suggestive of malignancy. Due to concern for multifocal disease, MRI breast with without contrast was done and it showed 2.3 x 1.1 x 2.7 cm irregular-shaped, heterogeneous mass with irregular margins in the upper outer quadrant of right breast, 7 cm from the nipple, 1.2 cm from the skin and there was an additional mass measuring 8 mm x 4 mm x 1.6 cm at 12:00 along with 4 mm lesion, 7 mm from the nipple at 10:00 (Figures (a) and (b)). Right breast biopsy from the dominant lesion showed invasive mammary carcinoma with features of both lobular and ductal carcinoma, Nottingham histological grade 2, estrogen receptor 90%, progesterone receptor 100%, HER2 2+ by IHC but negative by FISH, Ki-67 50%.Status post right breast simple mastectomy and axillary lymph node evaluation. Surgical pathology showed a multifocal invasive mammary carcinoma of the breast with ductal and lobular features, size of largest invasive carcinoma was 55 mm, size of additional invasive foci was 1.5 mm, Nottingham histological grade 2 of 3, low to intermediate nuclear grade DCIS without central necrosis measuring at least 6 mm, margins uninvolved, one benign sentinel lymph node. Pathological staging (m)pT3 (sn)N0. Oncotype DX breast recurrence score of 16 (for patients <50 years of age, benefit from chemotherapy 1.6%). Genetic testing did not reveal any clinically significant mutations. The patient has received adjuvant PMRT 5000 cGy dose, 25 fractions along with 1000 cGy scar boost. Based on TEXT/SOFT data ovarian suppression could be considered in patients with high-risk features. The patient's tumor was multifocal, and the largest lesion measured 5.5 cm. The patient elected against surgical menopause. The patient was started on ovarian suppression with goserelin 3.6 mg every 28 days along with letrozole 2.5 mg once daily.Sixteen months after initiation of ovarian suppression patient started having a regular menstrual cycle while on goserelin. No medication interaction or missed doses were noted. The patient's BMI was 41.1 and BSA was 2.19 m2. Estradiol was 92 pg/mL and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was 4.3 mIU/mL in the premenopausal range. Few prior case reports showing failure of goserelin ovarian ablation in a premenopausal woman were reported. Given high-risk disease, discussed benefit of continued ovarian suppression plus AIs versus tamoxifen alone, and discussed the role of oophorectomy which results are reliable and prompt reduction in circulating estrogens. The patient was hesitant and wished to wait before the oophorectomy. She was started on triptorelin 3.75 mg IM once every 28 days.", "topic_list":"['the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)','select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study','select most likely diagnosis','selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy','appropriate surgical management']"},
{"clinical_note":"This 66-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital due to an ischemic left-hemispheric stroke in addition to a dry cough and fever. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 the following day but continued to deteriorate resulting in severe ARDS, intubation, and ICU admission. Despite repeated proning, gas exchange did not improve sufficiently and the patient was placed on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 7 days. After sedation was stopped, the patient continued to be somnolent and unable to communicate or to follow commands. Physical therapy therefore focused on perception training, movement exercises, airway-clearing techniques, dysphagia therapy, and mobilization. A first SOEB trial had to be discontinued due to hemodynamic instability. Instead, the patient was positioned in a side-edge position (), which he tolerated better and where an intensive exercise training including trunk and head control was conducted. Nevertheless, muscle tone and strength remained severely reduced, particularly on his hemiplegic side, and a second SOEB trial failed again. Physical therapy was also limited because of reduced self-activity and suspected impaired perception and visual acuity. Consequently, occupational therapy was involved to create a basis of communication, to support functional initiation of upper limb movements, and to integrate perception-training into activities of daily living. Currently, the patient tolerates spontaneous breathing trials, shows signs of being alert during therapy, but cannot communicate. He is hemodynamically stable, even in an SOEB position, but remains functionally dependent (CPAx 6/50).","topic_list":"['mechanisms, drugs','select most likely diagnosis','selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy','most appropriate management of selected conditions','most appropriate long-term treatment']"},
{"clinical_note":"This 52-year-old male tested COVID-19 positive 4 days after the beginning of a dry cough, fever, and head and limb pain. One day later, he was hospitalized with exertional dyspnea. He was diagnosed with pneumonia that developed into moderate ARDS needing mechanical ventilation and intermittent dialysis. After extubation, oxygenation was stable with 2 to 3 L/min of oxygen. However, the patient was disoriented and could not communicate verbally. His global weakness (CPAx 11/50) was accompanied by oral and pharyngeal weakness and paresthesia. Spontaneous swallowing frequency and tongue control were severely reduced, and the patient showed insufficient protection from aspiration. This was confirmed by a specialized physical therapist with the Gugging Swallowing Screen, which confirmed severe dysphagia with 2/20 points. He was treated nil by mouth and received dysphagia therapy such as intensive oral stimulation, facilitation of swallowing, and training of protection mechanisms. After initial agitation and disorientation, the patient started to communicate in single-word phrases, but dysphagia continued to be severe with massive oral and pharyngeal dry saliva residuals that compromised his paresthesia and required regular mouth care. Over the next days, the patient managed to swallow pureÃ©d food and mildly thick fluids under supervision, although cough strength was still weak (Gugging Swallowing Screen 13/20, CPAx 30/50). Nevertheless, he continued to progress and became capable of independent food ingestion (Gugging Swallowing Screen 20/20, CPAx 39/50) before his discharge to a rehabilitation clinic 25 days after admission.","topic_list":["knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders","select most appropriate laboratory or diagnostic study","recognizes associated conditions of a disease","selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy","immediate management or priority in management"]}
