[{"clinical_note":"A 58-year-old Caucasian woman, with past medical history significant for a 2.4 cm GIST diagnosed with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) (Figures , ) (performed for persistent epigastric pain despite therapy) six months earlier and s\/p laparoscopic partial gastrectomy, presented to the emergency department (ED) with new-onset jaundice initially observed by her son four days prior to arrival. Also, she reported generalized weakness, fatigue, and itching for the past several days. The patient reported no previous history of alcohol consumption, intravenous drug use, acquiring tattoos or non-sterile piercings, receiving transfusions of blood or blood products, sexual promiscuity, residence in a developing country, occupational exposure to toxins (she worked as a school teacher), or prior liver diseases. She reported no family history of liver diseases. The earlier biopsy had shown GIST, histologic grade G2 (high grade; mitotic rate > 5\/50 per high-power field (HPF)), with spindle cells and no necrosis (Figures , ). The margins were negative. The tumor cells were positive \/ immunoreactive for CD34, CD117, and DOG-1 (Figures , ). A recent follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan showed no recurrence.\nAt presentation, the patient appeared icteric with yellowish discoloration of the skin and sclera. She was afebrile (temperature 97.4) and hemodynamically stable (heart rate 72 beats per minute (BPM), blood pressure 110\/85 mm Hg). On physical exam, the abdomen was soft and not distended, with no tenderness and normoactive bowel sounds. Murphy\u2019s sign was negative and there was no guarding nor rigidity.\nInitial laboratory testing showed significantly elevated transaminases with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 1450 U\/L (10-35 U\/L) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 1632 U\/L (10-55 U\/L). Also, there were increased total bilirubin of 4.9 mg\/dL (<1.2 mg\/dL) and increased direct bilirubin of 2.7 mg\/dL (<0.6 mg\/dL). The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was 162 U\/L (40-150 U\/L), the gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) was 95 U\/L (5-50 U\/L), and the international normalized ratio (INR) was elevated at 1.9 (0.8-1.2). The serum total protein, serum albumin, serum electrolytes, and complete blood count (CBC) were within normal limits. The patient\u2019s Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was calculated to be 28 upon arrival.\nFurther laboratory testing showed that the serum iron level, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), serum ferritin, ceruloplasmin level, and thyroid function tests (TFTs) were within normal limits. An acetaminophen level and an autoimmune workup, including antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), and anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA), were negative. And, viral serologies for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were negative. An abdominal ultrasound revealed mild hepatomegaly.\nUpon medication reconciliation, it was discovered that the patient was taking imatinib, prescribed by her hematologist-oncologist, for the past four months. The medication was discontinued on hospital admission due to the concern for hepatotoxicity. No other potentially hepatotoxic medications were noted. Prior liver function tests (LFTs), before initiation of imatinib, were all within normal limits. As the LFTs were not improving with conservative management, an interventional radiology (IR)-guided liver biopsy was performed for the purpose of diagnosis as well as to assess the extent of liver injury (Figures -).\nAfter seven days, the patient\u2019s transaminases began to decrease, ultimately falling to AST of 483 U\/L and ALT of 544 U\/L during the hospital admission. The transaminases, as well as the rest of the LFTs, continued to trend down and were within normal range two months later.","topic":"select most likely diagnosis","keypoint":"Hepatotoxicity due to medication (imatinib)"},{"clinical_note":"A 76-year-old man was referred to our service for progressive redness and pain in the right eye.

His ocular and medical history and review of systems were unremarkable. BCVA in the right eye was 20\/25 and slit-lamp examination revealed limbal injection, fine inferior keratic precipitates, and temporal corneal thinning with an overlying epithelial defect that measured 5 mm vertically and 2 mm horizontally and stained with fluorescein. The presumptive diagnosis of PUK was made and the patient was started on moxifloxacin q.i.d., doxycycline 100 mg bid, vitamin C 1 g bid, and topical lubricants.\nLab workup was notable for positive purified protein derivative (PPD) and QuantiFERON gold. Cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody test, a marker for rheumatoid arthritis, was also positive. All other laboratory assays were unremarkable and chest x-ray was normal.

We also consulted the rheumatology service that recommended we proceed with immunosuppression using prednisone 1 mg\/kg and mycophenolic acid.\nHis condition improved after one month and a prednisone taper was initiated. However, PUK recurred, at which point oral prednisone was restarted at the original moderate dose and amniotic membrane was placed via a PROKERA lens (Bio-Tissue, Doral, FL) to promote epithelial corneal healing. He returned two weeks later with worsening keratitis at which point the lens was removed and topical prednisolone acetate t.i.d. was initiated. Symptoms stably improved for three months, after which he was very slowly tapered off topical and systemic prednisone. At his last visit, 16 months after presentation, he remains asymptomatic with a BCVA of 20\/30. demonstrates a slit-lamp photograph taken at presentation and AS-OCT images taken before and after treatment. The etiology for this patient's PUK was deemed related to his autoimmune disorder with possible rheumatoid arthritis.

Immediately after gazing at the sun, the subject reported having bilateral central scotoma and decreased vision. At the time of the incident, the patient was taking etizolam for a psychiatric condition (panic disorder). At the first visit, his decimal best corrected visual acuity was 0.8 (logMAR conversion: 0.10) (with -3.00 diopters, cylinder -1.00 diopters axis 5\u00b0) in the right eye and 0.7 (logMAR conversion: 0.15) (with -3.00 diopters, cylinder -1.00 diopters axis 180\u00b0) in the left eye. Slit lamp examinations showed no abnormalities in the anterior segments and media of both eyes. Fundus examinations showed a tiny, yellowish spot in the fovea bilaterally (). FAF (Spectralis HRA; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) (), fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography all indicated that there were no remarkable abnormalities in either of the eyes. OCT (Cirrus HD-OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Dublin, CA, USA) images showed an elevated and blurred ellipsoid zone along with loss of the interdigitation zone at the foveal area bilaterally (). There was also no vitreomacular adhesion or traction seen in either of the eyes (). When the findings were taken together, the patient was diagnosed with solar retinopathy due to the characteristic symptoms and bilateral findings present after an episode of sun gazing. Treatment was started at the first visit, with the patient given a posterior sub-Tenon triamcinolone injection in his right eye followed by being placed on oral prednisolone therapy (30 mg per day) on the same day. The prednisolone therapy was decreased over a 12-week tapering period. There were no changes noted in the decimal best corrected visual acuity at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after starting the medication.

She was hospitalized because of severe diarrhea (7 times\/ d) with muco-bloody stools for one week. The stool frequency was five times a day. Her previous medical history revealed exposure to trichloroethylene (TCE) for one year. (Table ) Physical examination at admission revealed extensive abdominal tenderness. Fecal occult blood tests were positive. Other serological markers for autoimmunity and viral serology were normal, as was stool examination for bacteria and parasites. However, abdominal X-ray showed multiple intraluminal gas pockets in the left colon (Fig. ). Coronal reconstruction confirmed the widespread serosal intestinal air cysts involving long segment of colon (Fig. ). Colonoscopy revealed grape-like or beaded subepithelial lesions, and some with erythematous mucosa distributed in the sigmoid. Given the narrowing of the lumen secondary to these lesions the colonoscopy was incomplete (Fig. ). The endoscopic ultrasonography showed low echo of cystic below the mucosal layer (Fig. ). We used high frequency electrosurgical resection of the gas cysts; But considering that extensive endoscopic therapy might lead to infection, we used only partial treatment. Since the narrow lumen of the patient, we restricted her food intake and used parenteral nutrition. One week later, the patient started to have a half-fluid diet. Ornidazole (500 mg\/bid) and vitamin B2 (10 mg\/bid) were given to regulate intestinal anaerobes, while bifidobacterium (420 mg\/bid) was given at intervals of half an hour. We also advised him to eat less gas-producing foods. The patients\u2019 condition improved after 2 weeks (Table ).

A pathological examination revealed an estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive), progesterone receptor-positive (PgR-positive), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2-positive) invasive ductal carcinoma. For postoperative therapy, 6 cycles of 5-fluorouracil+epirubicin+cyclophosphamide and oral tamoxifen were given. A right renal cell carcinoma was incidentally noted on computed tomography imaging performed at follow-up 2 years later, and a right nephrectomy was performed. A further 4 years later, a bone biopsy was performed for a suspected bone metastasis found at the distal end of the left femur. This lesion was diagnosed as a metastasis from the primary breast cancer. Since the bone metastasis was localized within a single site, radiation therapy to this site and high-dose toremifene therapy were administered. Fifteen years after the initial surgery, she developed a left lower abdominal pain, anuria, and body swelling. Computed tomography imaging revealed an irregular thickening of the left bladder wall, left hydronephrosis, and hydroureter (Fig. ). As the ureteral orifice was occluded, an urgent left nephrostomy was immediately performed. A cystoscopy revealed a broad-based tumor extending from the left wall to the triangle of the bladder. The ureteral orifice could not be identified. The tumor was biopsied, and a histopathological examination revealed a proliferation of cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and a rounded dentate macronucleus in the mucosal lamina propria (Fig. ). The immunostaining results revealed CD7 positivity, CD20 negativity, ER positivity, and HER2 positivity, confirming a diagnosis of bladder metastasis from breast cancer (Fig. ).

He was well until 2011 when he first developed a severe headache followed by right-hand weakness and numbness. He was taken to the hospital where a diagnosis of hemipalegic migraine was made. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed some white matter changes thought to be secondary to hemiplegic migraine at that time. He recovered complete neurological function with no residual deficits.\nOn this admission, the patient initially presented to the hospital with right-sided facial droop and weakness in the right lower extremity. The initial computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain was negative for acute bleed. An MRI of the brain was ordered because the patient continued to experience focal neurological deficits including right arm weakness, dysarthria, and decreased cognitive function on neurological examination and neuropsychiatric testing. At this point, it was thought that he had suffered an ischemic stroke, and the MRI showed multiple areas of restricted diffusion suggestive of embolic disease (Figure ). These findings called into question the diagnosis of hemiplegic migraine.\nThe patient received aspirin after ruling out active bleeding on non-contrast CT of the head. The search for an embolic source included a CT-angiograph of the neck which did not reveal carotid stenosis. He then had a transthoracic echocardiograph and a trans esophageal echocardiograph both of which were unremarkable. The differential diagnosis at that time included transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, brain tumors, central nervous system (CNS) infection, CNS vasculitis, inherited disorders including mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), CADASIL, and hereditary telangiectasia. A lumbar puncture was performed for possible meningitis. The cytology was negative and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was not suggestive of meningitis, neurosyphilis, or Lyme disease. Lyme serology, the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) blood tests were all negative. The CSF was also screened for possible multiple sclerosis, but no oligoclonal bands were detected. At this point, there was a concern for possible vasculitis as the cause of the patient's symptoms. Genetic testing for CADASIL was ordered, but the sample had to be sent out to a lab equipped to perform the genetic test and would take several weeks to return. He was placed on a five-day course of intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone which improved his neurological symptoms. Following completion of his steroid course, it was decided that an alternative to angiogram would be brain biopsy to look for CNS vasculitis. The patient and his family were eager to have an established diagnosis by the end of the hospital course, and the differential diagnosis included CNS vasculitis for which brain biopsy would provide valuable diagnostic information. Given the recent advances in imaging and neurosurgical techniques, the complication rate for routine biopsy has been reduced significantly. The patient elected to have the procedure performed. Rheumatology was consulted and an angiogram was recommended as well to rule out CNS vasculitis or vasospasm as a possible cause for the strokes. The patient had physical therapy and his motor and cognitive function gradually improved over the course of his hospital stay. The patient was accepted into a neurological rehabilitation facility and discharged on oral steroids. The results of the brain biopsy confirmed CADASIL after the patient was discharged to the rehabilitation facility. The results of the genetic tests for mutations in the NOTCH3 gene provided further confirmation with a sensitivity approaching 100%.","topic":"select most likely diagnosis","keypoint":"CADASIL diagnosis and genetic testing"},{"clinical_note":"The patient was a 65-year-old man with a prior history of repeated plastic surgery for scar contracture of the hands and fingers, ablation surgery for idiopathic ventricular tachycardia, and diabetes. There was no family history of no consanguineous marriage or EB.\nHe had experienced recurrent blistering of the skin that was readily caused by an external force since the time shortly after birth, which had been treated symptomatically. He was diagnosed with EB during a genetic consultation that he had received before getting married at the age of 28 years. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with RDEB at the age of 38 years. Application of a strong external force to the skin results in blister formation as early as 15 min. In June 2012, he presented to a nearby hospital with epigastric pain, where he was diagnosed with cholelithiasis and cancer in the transverse colon and was referred to our hospital. In September 2012, transverse colectomy and cholecystectomy were performed via laparotomy, followed by an uneventful postoperative course. In April 2013, a liver metastasis (S2) was detected. The lesion was a solitary tumor measuring \u22642 cm and was treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in June 2013, again followed by an uneventful postoperative course. In September 2015, a recurrent tumor was detected at the site of RFA, with suspected invasion into the diaphragm. He was then admitted to our hospital for curative open surgery. On admission, although no active blistering was noted, pigmentation and scars due to recurrent blistering were noted especially in the extremities and back. Most fingers in both hands were club-shaped, with a few intact fingers. Blood test showed a mild increase in glucose to 123 mg\/dl and increases in tumor markers, including mean levels of CEA and CA19-9 of 25.0 (0\u20135) ng\/ml and 62.1 (0\u201337) U\/ml, respectively.\nAbdominal CT\/MRI revealed a 3.5 cm metastatic liver carcinoma with diaphragmatic invasion in the lateral segment of the liver. In January 8, 2016, open partial hepatectomy of the lateral segment with combined diaphragmatic resection was performed.\nThe patient was asked to climb on the operating table on his own to minimize application of an external force to the skin. Epidural anesthesia was achieved by just one injection of 5 ml of 0.5% procaine into the epidural space. For endotracheal intubation, due to a difficulty in manually fixing a mask and lifting the lower jaw, the patient was asked to open his mouth and intubation was performed while the patient was conscious using intravenous injection of 1% propofol and intratracheal spraying of 1% xylocaine, under bronchoscopic guidance using a McGRATH\u2122 MAC video laryngoscope (Covidien). Isodine disinfectant was used for skin disinfection of the surgical site, as the patient was tolerant of chemical stimulations. A skin incision was made sharply with a scalpel, with particular care taken to avoid contact of a steel instrument with the skin. Partial hepatectomy of the lateral segment with combined diaphragmatic resection was performed. The diaphragmatic defect was closed with a 2-0 nonabsorbable suture while the lung was compressed, without chest tube placement. A 19 Fr closed low-pressure continuous-suction drain was placed on the liver resection surface. A block catheter was also placed on the bilateral rectus sheaths in case of postoperative wound pain. The wound was closed by two-layer suturing with a 0 monofilament absorbable suture for the peritoneal muscle layer and a 4-0 monofilament absorbable suture for dermal closure. The wound was covered with a Mepilex\u00ae Border Ag dressing (M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care). The drain was fixed with a needle and a suture and then with a Mepitac\u00ae tape (M\u00f6lnlycke Health Care).

The double nuclei and megaloblastic changes could also be observed in the granulocytic lineage (accounting for 4%). The number of megakaryocytes was increased and the production of thrombocytes was fine (Fig. ). In addition, bone marrow biopsy also revealed hypercellularity and erythroid hyperplasia. Cytogenetic analysis showed a normal 46 XX [20] karyotype.\nCombining her medical history with the clinical and laboratory parameters, a diagnosis of treatment-related MDS (t-MDS) was made. Disease modifying antirheumatic drug (MTX) might have been responsible for the bone marrow toxicity.\nThese results, in combination with the patient's history, led to the addition of tocilizumab to the treatment regimen. To evaluate the clinical effects of tocilizumab in the RA patient, WBC, Hb, ferritin, ESR\/CRP, and IL-6 were assessed at baseline, 1st, 3rd, and 6th months of tocilizumab treatment. She started therapy with intravenous injection of tocilizumab (8 mg\/kg) every 4 weeks and oral corticosteroids (15 mg\/QD), achieving clinical benefit and improvement in symptoms.

Repeat bone marrow aspiration at the 6-month follow-up showed that dysplasia was not obvious. Laboratory results showed no obvious abnormality. This resulted in the prompt resolution of the patient's serological, physical, and pathological abnormalities. Hence, the response to tocilizumab treatment was very good.\nHowever, it was shown to be unlikely that the use of low doses of steroids in the patient was responsible for the sustained disease control. The patient refused the injection of tocilizumab after the 6th month. CRP (92.6 mg\/L) increased and joint pain returned.
