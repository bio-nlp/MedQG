She was conscious and obeyed simple commands with eyes and mouth; however, she had severe dysarthria. She had bilateral facial palsy and bulbar palsy. She had flaccid, hyporeflexic, pure motor quadriplegia with limbs showing only a subtle withdrawal flicker to pain. MRI of the brain revealed hyperintensity in the central pons in diffusion-weighted images (Figure ), T2-weighted images (Figure ), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images (Figure ) without abnormal contrast enhancement (Figure ), consistent with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) (Figure ).The biochemical analysis showed hypernatremia while the remaining electrolytes were normal. The rest of the blood workup was unremarkable. Relatives denied an antecedent history of hyponatremia with rapid correction. The patient was started on sodium correction and was given five days intravenous (IV) pulse methylprednisolone 1 g/day to stabilize the blood-brain barrier. The patient recovered significantly to normal power. She was then considered to have idiopathic hypernatremic osmotic demyelination and was discharged with a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) of 0.One year later, she presented to the neurology department with a one-week history of generalized fatigue, diffuse myalgias, and three days history of rapidly progressive weakness of all four limbs making her wheelchair-bound one day before the presentation. Her initial vital signs were unremarkable. She was noted to have a pure motor flaccid symmetric quadriparesis with proximal more than distal weakness and generalized hyporeflexia. Clinical examination of other systems was normal. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) done on day three of onset of weakness demonstrated reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes of bilateral tibial and peroneal nerves with absent F waves and H reflexes. CMAP of tested nerves in upper limbs showed preserved amplitudes with normal distal latency and absent F waves. There were no conduction blocks. The sensory conduction study of all the tested nerves in all four limbs was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis did not show albumin-cytological dissociation. Therefore, acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) or hypokalemia-related electrophysiological abnormalities were considered. A basic metabolic panel revealed severe hypokalemia (potassium 2.2 mEq/L). Arterial blood gas (ABG) and 24-hour urine analysis showed metabolic acidosis, consistent with renal tubular acidosis type-1 (distal). Autoimmune workup was positive anti-SSA/Ro autoantibodies. The biopsy of the minor salivary gland was pathognomonic. The patient was diagnosed with pSS according to the new classification criteria proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). Overall clinical, electrical, and biochemical data suggest the presence of renal tubular acidosis with secondary hypokalemia-related quadriparesis due to pSS.The patient was given intravenous (IV) potassium supplementation through a peripheral vein at a rate not exceeding 10 mEq/hour and subsequently was shifted to oral liquid formulation in the form of a syrup. Oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation was given at a dose of 1 mEq/kg/day for renal tubular acidosis. With potassium correction, there was a rapid recovery in the power of all four limbs within 24 hours of admission. The patient was initiated on 1 mg/kg/day of oral prednisolone and was referred to a rheumatologist for further management. She remained asymptomatic on her six-month follow-up.",

      "clinical_note": "A 33-year-old female with no prior medical comorbidities, who recently gave birth to a healthy girl child four months ago, was brought to the emergency department with sudden onset weakness of both upper and lower limbs that started four days prior and rapidly progressed to a state of quadriplegia. She was conscious and obeyed simple commands with eyes and mouth; however, she had severe dysarthria. She had bilateral facial palsy and bulbar palsy. She had flaccid, hyporeflexic, pure motor quadriplegia with limbs showing only a subtle withdrawal flicker to pain. MRI of the brain revealed hyperintensity in the central pons in diffusion-weighted images (Figure ), T2-weighted images (Figure ), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images (Figure ) without abnormal contrast enhancement (Figure ), consistent with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) (Figure ).The biochemical analysis showed hypernatremia while the remaining electrolytes were normal. The rest of the blood workup was unremarkable. Relatives denied an antecedent history of hyponatremia with rapid correction. The patient was started on sodium correction and was given five days intravenous (IV) pulse methylprednisolone 1 g/day to stabilize the blood-brain barrier. The patient recovered significantly to normal power. She was then considered to have idiopathic hypernatremic osmotic demyelination and was discharged with a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) of 0.One year later, she presented to the neurology department with a one-week history of generalized fatigue, diffuse myalgias, and three days history of rapidly progressive weakness of all four limbs making her wheelchair-bound one day before the presentation. Her initial vital signs were unremarkable. She was noted to have a pure motor flaccid symmetric quadriparesis with proximal more than distal weakness and generalized hyporeflexia. Clinical examination of other systems was normal. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) done on day three of onset of weakness demonstrated reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes of bilateral tibial and peroneal nerves with absent F waves and H reflexes. CMAP of tested nerves in upper limbs showed preserved amplitudes with normal distal latency and absent F waves. There were no conduction blocks. The sensory conduction study of all the tested nerves in all four limbs was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis did not show albumin-cytological dissociation. Therefore, acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) or hypokalemia-related electrophysiological abnormalities were considered. A basic metabolic panel revealed severe hypokalemia (potassium 2.2 mEq/L). Arterial blood gas (ABG) and 24-hour urine analysis showed metabolic acidosis, consistent with renal tubular acidosis type-1 (distal). Autoimmune workup was positive anti-SSA/Ro autoantibodies. The biopsy of the minor salivary gland was pathognomonic. The patient was diagnosed with pSS according to the new classification criteria proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). Overall clinical, electrical, and biochemical data suggest the presence of renal tubular acidosis with secondary hypokalemia-related quadriparesis due to pSS.The patient was given intravenous (IV) potassium supplementation through a peripheral vein at a rate not exceeding 10 mEq/hour and subsequently was shifted to oral liquid formulation in the form of a syrup. Oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation was given at a dose of 1 mEq/kg/day for renal tubular acidosis. With potassium correction, there was a rapid recovery in the power of all four limbs within 24 hours of admission. The patient was initiated on 1 mg/kg/day of oral prednisolone and was referred to a rheumatologist for further management. She remained asymptomatic on her six-month follow-up.",

Her medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease with three prior myocardial infarctions, recurrent cerebrovascular accidents requiring anticoagulation with warfarin, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and endometrial cancer status post radiation therapy. Fifteen months prior to the current presentation, the patient was noted to have a grade 1 endometrial adenoma but was not considered a good surgical candidate due to multiple comorbidities. Vaginal hysterectomy was considered but due to her long and narrow vagina, this option was deferred initially. Her only treatment option was radiation therapy and brachytherapy. She eventually underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy due to continued pelvic pain. The patient denied any prior history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Her bleeding was described as one large episode of bright red blood per rectum associated with blood clots. She denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or melena. The most recent colonoscopy was performed four months ago and revealed three diminutive polyps in the transverse colon with pathology confirming tubular adenoma.Her physical examination was significant for mild left-sided abdominal tenderness but was otherwise unremarkable. Rectal examination was notable for nonbleeding hemorrhoids and no visible blood. Blood work revealed white blood cells of 14.3k/uL (normal range 4.3-10.0 k/uL) and hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL (normal range 11.8-14.8 g/dL), which is similar to the patient’s baseline. Creatinine was slightly elevated to 1.2 and blood urea nitrogen was elevated to 39. International normalized ratio was 2.0. Due the large volume of hematochezia and presence of anemia, the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed a large, fungating, friable, and ulcerated nonobstructing mass in the sigmoid colon. The mass was noncircumferential, measured 4 cm in length, and was located 15-19 cm from the anal verge (Figures , ). Biopsies were obtained with cold forceps for histology and the proximal and distal margins of the mass were tattooed. Histology showed invasive and moderately differentiated carcinoma without visible goblet cells. Given the patient’s history of endometrial cancer, immunohistochemistry was performed and was consistent with an endometrial (endometrioid subtype) primary.Pan-computed tomography was negative for any obvious distant disease. The tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen level was normal as well. The patient subsequently underwent surgical resection of the affected colon followed by radiation therapy.

Vaginal hysterectomy was considered but due to her long and narrow vagina, this option was deferred initially. Her only treatment option was radiation therapy and brachytherapy. She eventually underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy due to continued pelvic pain. The patient denied any prior history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Her bleeding was described as one large episode of bright red blood per rectum associated with blood clots. She denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or melena. The most recent colonoscopy was performed four months ago and revealed three diminutive polyps in the transverse colon with pathology confirming tubular adenoma.Her physical examination was significant for mild left-sided abdominal tenderness but was otherwise unremarkable. Rectal examination was notable for nonbleeding hemorrhoids and no visible blood. Blood work revealed white blood cells of 14.3k/uL (normal range 4.3-10.0 k/uL) and hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL (normal range 11.8-14.8 g/dL), which is similar to the patient’s baseline. Creatinine was slightly elevated to 1.2 and blood urea nitrogen was elevated to 39. International normalized ratio was 2.0. Due the large volume of hematochezia and presence of anemia, the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed a large, fungating, friable, and ulcerated nonobstructing mass in the sigmoid colon. The mass was noncircumferential, measured 4 cm in length, and was located 15-19 cm from the anal verge (Figures , ). Biopsies were obtained with cold forceps for histology and the proximal and distal margins of the mass were tattooed. Histology showed invasive and moderately differentiated carcinoma without visible goblet cells. Given the patient’s history of endometrial cancer, immunohistochemistry was performed and was consistent with an endometrial (endometrioid subtype) primary.Pan-computed tomography was negative for any obvious distant disease. The tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen level was normal as well. The patient subsequently underwent surgical resection of the affected colon followed by radiation therapy. At a follow-up visit one year later, the patient was doing well without active GI complaints.",

The patient was transferred from an outside facility where he was found to be hypoxic, saturating 79% on room air, chest X-ray showing infiltrates, and a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The patient had received two doses of the COVID vaccine, with the second dose in March 2021. Upon arrival to the general medical ward, the patient's vital signs were BP 132/79, HR 84 bpm, RR 18 breaths/min, oxygen saturation of 100% on 2-4 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, and afebrile. Laboratory assessment is in Table . The patient was quickly weaned to room air, with SpO2 of 94-98%; hence, only supportive care was provided for COVID-19. On Day 1, the patient was found to have a right foot wound infection and was started on intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. On Day 2, the patient was found to be hypoxic, put on 5 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, and started on dexamethasone and remdesivir. Because of end-stage renal disease, the patient did not qualify for baricitinib. On Day 4, the patient required 10 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula, which he needed until Day 12, when we could start weaning down the supplemental oxygen over the next 3-4 days until Day 15 to room air. On Day 17, the patient was put back on 2 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula which quickly escalated to 15 L on a nonrebreather mask within 2-3 hours, requiring the patient to get transferred to the intensive care unit on Day 18. At this time, he was put on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) with 40 L per minute of supplemental oxygen. Chest X-ray showed extensive diffuse airspace infiltrates, which significantly worsened from one week prior (Figure ). He was dialyzed without improvement from a respiratory standpoint and then intubated on Day 19.

The patient had received two doses of the COVID vaccine, with the second dose in March 2021. Upon arrival to the general medical ward, the patient's vital signs were BP 132/79, HR 84 bpm, RR 18 breaths/min, oxygen saturation of 100% on 2-4 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, and afebrile. Laboratory assessment is in Table . The patient was quickly weaned to room air, with SpO2 of 94-98%; hence, only supportive care was provided for COVID-19. On Day 1, the patient was found to have a right foot wound infection and was started on intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. On Day 2, the patient was found to be hypoxic, put on 5 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, and started on dexamethasone and remdesivir. Because of end-stage renal disease, the patient did not qualify for baricitinib. On Day 4, the patient required 10 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula, which he needed until Day 12, when we could start weaning down the supplemental oxygen over the next 3-4 days until Day 15 to room air. On Day 17, the patient was put back on 2 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula which quickly escalated to 15 L on a nonrebreather mask within 2-3 hours, requiring the patient to get transferred to the intensive care unit on Day 18. At this time, he was put on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) with 40 L per minute of supplemental oxygen. Chest X-ray showed extensive diffuse airspace infiltrates, which significantly worsened from one week prior (Figure ). He was dialyzed without improvement from a respiratory standpoint and then intubated on Day 19.

      "clinical_note": " A 54-year-old Caucasian male patient was referred to our institution, initially with the diagnosis of a T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, which was refractory to two courses of chemotherapy (CHOEP: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, vincristine, etoposide and prednisolone). At presentation an erythroderma involving >90% of the integument was predominant (). Computer tomography (CT) scans showed enlarged axillary, inguinal and cervical lymph nodes. The complete blood counts showed a leukocytosis of 24,300/µl. Flow cytometry of the pb revealed 11,664 Sézary cells/µl with CD4+CD7- phenotype and with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 85.5. Flow cytometry of the bone marrow aspirate confirmed CD30 positivity with expression of 7% in Sézary cells. Polymerase chain reaction of pb confirmed the clonality in T-cell receptor beta and gamma showing monoclonal Vβ-β2 and two clonal Vγ1-8-Jγ1.1 and 2.1 rearrangements. While conventional cytogenetics showed a normal male karyotype, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) detected the deletion of chromosome 17p in 22 of 200 interphases with deletion of TP53 gene. Immunohistochemistry of both trephine biopsy () and skin histology revealed infiltrations with Sézary cells (). The skin histology also confirmed CD30 positivity with 5-10%, and the diagnosis was revised to SS.The diagnosis was thus revised to Sézary Syndrome in Stage IVA (pT4 Nx M0 B2) according to the updated classification of International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL) and the European Organization of Research and Treatment (EORTC) ().Subsequently, successive therapies with 3,000,000 IU interferon alpha three times weekly for 6 months, combined with 10 mg/m2 methotrexate (MTX) and 19 courses ECP including bexarotene showed no improvement.Six months prior to alloHSCT an antibody-conjugate treatment with brentuximab vedotin (BV) was administered. The patient received five courses, which led to an improvement of skin lesions and their reduction to about 30% of body surface. CT scans showed no further progression of the lymph nodes, the CD4:CD8 ratio was 76.7 with 63.5% Sézary cells in the flow-cytometry, confirming stable disease according to the EORTC and ISCL classification (, ).Due to preexisting comorbidities, we performed an alloHSCT from an unrelated HLA identical (10/10) and cytomegaly virus matched (recipient and donor IgG positive) 30 year old male donor with non-myeloablative conditioning (fludarabine 30 mg/m² body surface area on d-4 to -2 and total body irradiation with 2 Gy on day -1) followed by infusion of pb stem cells (). Immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine A from d-1 (blood target level 200 ng/ml) and mycophenolate mofetil (3x1000 mg per day). The patient received a total of 6.6x106 CD34+ cells/kg body weight, 1.1x108 CD3+ cells/kg body weight and 0.2x108 CD16+ cells/kg body weight. In the absence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), mycophenolate-mofetil was tapered 500 mg every 14 days from day 40 and discontinued on day 74 while cyclosporine A was tapered from day +56 and discontinued on d+196.The restaging on day +30 and +90 after alloHSCT showed residual infiltration of SS cells in the FACS analysis of the bone marrow (13 and 5% of all WBC, respectively) and chimerism of 70 and 93% on sorted CD3+ cells. The CT scan on day +90 after alloHSCT confirmed the persistent lymphadenopathy. On day + 172 after alloHCT a complete hematological remission (CR) with no infiltration of SS in bone marrow trephine biopsy, 100% chimerism on sorted CD3 positive cells from bone marrow aspirate and normal pb CD4:CD 8 ratio was documented, thus confirming graft-vs-Sézary effect (). The CT scan showed no lymph node enlargements. The inspection of the skin revealed no suspect lesions.After discontinuation of immunosuppression the patient developed chronic GvHD of the ocular mucosa and the liver according to national institutes of health (NIH) criteria () on day 277 and required immunosuppressive treatment with intermediate dosage of methylprednisolone, cyclosporine A and mycophenolic acid. The immunosuppression could have been slowly tapered to 720 mg mycophenolic acid b.i.d, 5 mg prednisolone and autologous plasma eye drops as previously described (, ). Furthermore, since September 2021 ruxolitinib was added to the GvHD treatment (). Currently, 1215 days after alloHSCT the patient is in continuous complete remission of SS, having active ocular chronic GvHD.",

At presentation an erythroderma involving >90% of the integument was predominant (). Computer tomography (CT) scans showed enlarged axillary, inguinal and cervical lymph nodes. The complete blood counts showed a leukocytosis of 24,300/µl. Flow cytometry of the pb revealed 11,664 Sézary cells/µl with CD4+CD7- phenotype and with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 85.5. Flow cytometry of the bone marrow aspirate confirmed CD30 positivity with expression of 7% in Sézary cells. Polymerase chain reaction of pb confirmed the clonality in T-cell receptor beta and gamma showing monoclonal Vβ-β2 and two clonal Vγ1-8-Jγ1.1 and 2.1 rearrangements. While conventional cytogenetics showed a normal male karyotype, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) detected the deletion of chromosome 17p in 22 of 200 interphases with deletion of TP53 gene. Immunohistochemistry of both trephine biopsy () and skin histology revealed infiltrations with Sézary cells (). The skin histology also confirmed CD30 positivity with 5-10%, and the diagnosis was revised to SS.The diagnosis was thus revised to Sézary Syndrome in Stage IVA (pT4 Nx M0 B2) according to the updated classification of International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL) and the European Organization of Research and Treatment (EORTC) ().Subsequently, successive therapies with 3,000,000 IU interferon alpha three times weekly for 6 months, combined with 10 mg/m2 methotrexate (MTX) and 19 courses ECP including bexarotene showed no improvement.Six months prior to alloHSCT an antibody-conjugate treatment with brentuximab vedotin (BV) was administered. The patient received five courses, which led to an improvement of skin lesions and their reduction to about 30% of body surface. CT scans showed no further progression of the lymph nodes, the CD4:CD8 ratio was 76.7 with 63.5% Sézary cells in the flow-cytometry, confirming stable disease according to the EORTC and ISCL classification (, ).Due to preexisting comorbidities, we performed an alloHSCT from an unrelated HLA identical (10/10) and cytomegaly virus matched (recipient and donor IgG positive) 30 year old male donor with non-myeloablative conditioning (fludarabine 30 mg/m² body surface area on d-4 to -2 and total body irradiation with 2 Gy on day -1) followed by infusion of pb stem cells (). Immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine A from d-1 (blood target level 200 ng/ml) and mycophenolate mofetil (3x1000 mg per day). The patient received a total of 6.6x106 CD34+ cells/kg body weight, 1.1x108 CD3+ cells/kg body weight and 0.2x108 CD16+ cells/kg body weight. In the absence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), mycophenolate-mofetil was tapered 500 mg every 14 days from day 40 and discontinued on day 74 while cyclosporine A was tapered from day +56 and discontinued on d+196.The restaging on day +30 and +90 after alloHSCT showed residual infiltration of SS cells in the FACS analysis of the bone marrow (13 and 5% of all WBC, respectively) and chimerism of 70 and 93% on sorted CD3+ cells. The CT scan on day +90 after alloHSCT confirmed the persistent lymphadenopathy. On day + 172 after alloHCT a complete hematological remission (CR) with no infiltration of SS in bone marrow trephine biopsy, 100% chimerism on sorted CD3 positive cells from bone marrow aspirate and normal pb CD4:CD 8 ratio was documented, thus confirming graft-vs-Sézary effect (). The CT scan showed no lymph node enlargements. The inspection of the skin revealed no suspect lesions.After discontinuation of immunosuppression the patient developed chronic GvHD of the ocular mucosa and the liver according to national institutes of health (NIH) criteria () on day 277 and required immunosuppressive treatment with intermediate dosage of methylprednisolone, cyclosporine A and mycophenolic acid. The immunosuppression could have been slowly tapered to 720 mg mycophenolic acid b.i.d, 5 mg prednisolone and autologous plasma eye drops as previously described (, ). Furthermore, since September 2021 ruxolitinib was added to the GvHD treatment ().

      "clinical_note": "A 41-year-old Japanese woman presented to our clinic with a 4 month history of bilateral groin pain and right buttock pain. Her right hip was more painful than her left hip. There was no history of trauma, alcohol abuse, or steroid use. Her medical history included iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed 2 years earlier, after which she had been on iron supplements. She had no fracture episodes, including fragility fractures.\nHer height, body weight, and body mass index were 155 cm, 42 kg, and 18.7 kg/m2, respectively. She was able to walk for approximately 10 minutes without a stick, albeit at a slow speed. Limitations in the passive motion of her bilateral hip joint were observed thus: flexion, 100°, internal rotation 5°, external rotation 15°, and abduction 20°, on both sides. She was able to perform a straight-leg raise of the right limb with substantial pain. The neurovascular status of both lower extremities was intact. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association scoring system for the evaluation of hip-joint function (JOA hip score) was 46 points for her right hip and 56 points for her left hip. The score was based on a total of 100 points, comprising 40 for pain, 20 for range of motion, 20 for the ability to walk, and 20 for activities of daily living [].\nStandard radiographs of both hips (Fig. a–c) demonstrated no characteristic findings such as the crescent sign, sclerotic band pattern, and collapse of the femoral head, and no joint space narrowing was seen in either femoral head. MRI of both hips (Fig. d, e) presented a low signal line in the subchondral region of the femoral head in the T1 weighted image and high signal region in almost all of the femoral head in the short tau inversion recovery (STIR). The oblique axial views of the proton density-weighted image showed a low-signal sinuous line in the anteromedial region of the femoral head (Fig. ). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) values were low in both femoral necks. Bone mineral density was 0.909 g/cm2 (T-score –0.9, Z-score −0.8) in the lumbar spine, 0.594 g/cm2 (T-score −1.8, Z-score −1.4) in the right femoral neck, and 0.529 g/cm2 (T-score −2.4, Z-score −2.0) in the left femoral neck. Laboratory findings were as follows: C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.03 mg/dl (normal range: 0–0.5 mg/dl); alkaline phosphatase 608 IU/l (40–150 IU/l); calcium 9.0 mg/dl (8.4–10.2 mg/dl); albumin 4.4 g/d (3.9–4.9 g/d); and hemoglobin 9.7 g/dl (12–16 g/dl). Bone turnover markers were as follows: tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP-5b) 463 mU/dl (premenopausal normal range: 120–420 mU/dl) and total procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (Total P1NP) 72.7 ng/ml (26.4–98.2 ng/ml). We diagnosed bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head and classified it as stage 1 in both femoral heads, according to the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) classification [].\nThe patient was instructed not to take as much weight as possible using sticks on the right side. Her symptoms improved immediately. However, 6 months later, her symptoms increased slightly without any traumatic episodes. Radiographic findings indicated almost no change (Fig. a–c). However, a slight signal change in the medial subcapital region was observed in the MRI scan (Fig. d, e). Her pain gradually increased thereafter, and 10 months after her first visit, walking became difficult. The JOA hip score decreased to 34 points in both hips; still, no changes could be observed in the radiograph (Fig. a–c). MRI of both hips showed a nondisplaced subcapital fracture on the medial side of both femoral necks, with bone marrow edema around the fracture (Fig. d, e). Because the cause of the fractures was not identified, the DEXA and bone turnover markers were measured again, and 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D was measured for the first time. All DEXA values decreased. The bone mineral density was 0.849 g/cm2 (T-score −1.5, Z-score −1.2) in the lumbar spine, 0.527 g/ cm2 (T-score −2.4, Z-score −2.1) in the right femoral neck, and 0.490 g/cm2 (T-score −2.7, Z-score −2.4) in the left femoral neck. TRACP-5b level increased to 607 mU/dl, and total P1NP decreased to 52.7 ng/ml. Her 25(OH) vitamin D level was 11.1 ng/dL and she was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. Based on the above results, our diagnosis was bilateral stress fracture of the femoral neck secondary to osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The patient underwent internal fixation of both hips with sliding hip screws (Dual SC screw system; Kisco, Kobe, Japan) to stabilize the stress fractures. In addition, the reaming performed before inserting of the sliding hip screw served as core decompression for the femoral heads [, ]. The specimens obtained from the reaming were examined histologically. Definitive findings of osteonecrosis such as bone marrow necrosis and loss of osteocyte nuclei in the femoral heads were observed (Fig. ). Postoperative radiographs showed no evidence of displacement of the fractures (Fig. ). We administered eldecalcitol 0.75 μg per day orally for vitamin D deficiency, and daily subcutaneous injections of teriparatide acetate. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient began to bear weight as tolerated with the use of an assistive device bilaterally. One month postoperatively, she was able to walk without pain and used a cane part time. She eventually regained full walking ability without a cane 3 months after surgery. Furthermore, her JOA hip score improved to 90 points in both hip joints at 5 months after surgery. Radiographs showed no evidence of recurrent stress fracture in the femoral neck or progression of osteonecrosis (Fig. ). Sequential oblique axial MRI showed that the necrotic region of the femoral head had decreased 5 months after surgery (Fig. ).",

      "clinical_note": "A 41-year-old Japanese woman presented to our clinic with a 4 month history of bilateral groin pain and right buttock pain. Her right hip was more painful than her left hip. There was no history of trauma, alcohol abuse, or steroid use. Her medical history included iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed 2 years earlier, after which she had been on iron supplements. She had no fracture episodes, including fragility fractures.\nHer height, body weight, and body mass index were 155 cm, 42 kg, and 18.7 kg/m2, respectively. She was able to walk for approximately 10 minutes without a stick, albeit at a slow speed. Limitations in the passive motion of her bilateral hip joint were observed thus: flexion, 100°, internal rotation 5°, external rotation 15°, and abduction 20°, on both sides. She was able to perform a straight-leg raise of the right limb with substantial pain. The neurovascular status of both lower extremities was intact. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association scoring system for the evaluation of hip-joint function (JOA hip score) was 46 points for her right hip and 56 points for her left hip. The score was based on a total of 100 points, comprising 40 for pain, 20 for range of motion, 20 for the ability to walk, and 20 for activities of daily living [].\nStandard radiographs of both hips (Fig. a–c) demonstrated no characteristic findings such as the crescent sign, sclerotic band pattern, and collapse of the femoral head, and no joint space narrowing was seen in either femoral head. MRI of both hips (Fig. d, e) presented a low signal line in the subchondral region of the femoral head in the T1 weighted image and high signal region in almost all of the femoral head in the short tau inversion recovery (STIR). The oblique axial views of the proton density-weighted image showed a low-signal sinuous line in the anteromedial region of the femoral head (Fig. ). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) values were low in both femoral necks. Bone mineral density was 0.909 g/cm2 (T-score –0.9, Z-score −0.8) in the lumbar spine, 0.594 g/cm2 (T-score −1.8, Z-score −1.4) in the right femoral neck, and 0.529 g/cm2 (T-score −2.4, Z-score −2.0) in the left femoral neck. Laboratory findings were as follows: C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.03 mg/dl (normal range: 0–0.5 mg/dl); alkaline phosphatase 608 IU/l (40–150 IU/l); calcium 9.0 mg/dl (8.4–10.2 mg/dl); albumin 4.4 g/d (3.9–4.9 g/d); and hemoglobin 9.7 g/dl (12–16 g/dl). Bone turnover markers were as follows: tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP-5b) 463 mU/dl (premenopausal normal range: 120–420 mU/dl) and total procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (Total P1NP) 72.7 ng/ml (26.4–98.2 ng/ml). We diagnosed bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head and classified it as stage 1 in both femoral heads, according to the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) classification [].\nThe patient was instructed not to take as much weight as possible using sticks on the right side. Her symptoms improved immediately. However, 6 months later, her symptoms increased slightly without any traumatic episodes. Radiographic findings indicated almost no change (Fig. a–c). However, a slight signal change in the medial subcapital region was observed in the MRI scan (Fig. d, e). Her pain gradually increased thereafter, and 10 months after her first visit, walking became difficult. The JOA hip score decreased to 34 points in both hips; still, no changes could be observed in the radiograph (Fig. a–c). MRI of both hips showed a nondisplaced subcapital fracture on the medial side of both femoral necks, with bone marrow edema around the fracture (Fig. d, e). Because the cause of the fractures was not identified, the DEXA and bone turnover markers were measured again, and 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D was measured for the first time. All DEXA values decreased. The bone mineral density was 0.849 g/cm2 (T-score −1.5, Z-score −1.2) in the lumbar spine, 0.527 g/ cm2 (T-score −2.4, Z-score −2.1) in the right femoral neck, and 0.490 g/cm2 (T-score −2.7, Z-score −2.4) in the left femoral neck. TRACP-5b level increased to 607 mU/dl, and total P1NP decreased to 52.7 ng/ml. Her 25(OH) vitamin D level was 11.1 ng/dL and she was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. Based on the above results, our diagnosis was bilateral stress fracture of the femoral neck secondary to osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The patient underwent internal fixation of both hips with sliding hip screws (Dual SC screw system; Kisco, Kobe, Japan) to stabilize the stress fractures. In addition, the reaming performed before inserting of the sliding hip screw served as core decompression for the femoral heads [, ]. The specimens obtained from the reaming were examined histologically. Definitive findings of osteonecrosis such as bone marrow necrosis and loss of osteocyte nuclei in the femoral heads were observed (Fig. ). Postoperative radiographs showed no evidence of displacement of the fractures (Fig. ). We administered eldecalcitol 0.75 μg per day orally for vitamin D deficiency, and daily subcutaneous injections of teriparatide acetate. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient began to bear weight as tolerated with the use of an assistive device bilaterally. One month postoperatively, she was able to walk without pain and used a cane part time. She eventually regained full walking ability without a cane 3 months after surgery. Furthermore, her JOA hip score improved to 90 points in both hip joints at 5 months after surgery. Radiographs showed no evidence of recurrent stress fracture in the femoral neck or progression of osteonecrosis (Fig. ). Sequential oblique axial MRI showed that the necrotic region of the femoral head had decreased 5 months after surgery (Fig. ).",

TRACP-5b level increased to 607 mU/dl, and total P1NP decreased to 52.7 ng/ml. Her 25(OH) vitamin D level was 11.1 ng/dL and she was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. Based on the above results, our diagnosis was bilateral stress fracture of the femoral neck secondary to osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The patient underwent internal fixation of both hips with sliding hip screws (Dual SC screw system; Kisco, Kobe, Japan) to stabilize the stress fractures. In addition, the reaming performed before inserting of the sliding hip screw served as core decompression for the femoral heads [, ]. The specimens obtained from the reaming were examined histologically. Definitive findings of osteonecrosis such as bone marrow necrosis and loss of osteocyte nuclei in the femoral heads were observed (Fig. ). Postoperative radiographs showed no evidence of displacement of the fractures (Fig. ). We administered eldecalcitol 0.75 μg per day orally for vitamin D deficiency, and daily subcutaneous injections of teriparatide acetate. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient began to bear weight as tolerated with the use of an assistive device bilaterally. One month postoperatively, she was able to walk without pain and used a cane part time. She eventually regained full walking ability without a cane 3 months after surgery. Furthermore, her JOA hip score improved to 90 points in both hip joints at 5 months after surgery. Radiographs showed no evidence of recurrent stress fracture in the femoral neck or progression of osteonecrosis (Fig. ). Sequential oblique axial MRI showed that the necrotic region of the femoral head had decreased 5 months after surgery (Fig. ).",

      "clinical_note": "A 41-year-old Japanese woman presented to our clinic with a 4 month history of bilateral groin pain and right buttock pain. Her right hip was more painful than her left hip. There was no history of trauma, alcohol abuse, or steroid use. Her medical history included iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed 2 years earlier, after which she had been on iron supplements. She had no fracture episodes, including fragility fractures.\nHer height, body weight, and body mass index were 155 cm, 42 kg, and 18.7 kg/m2, respectively. She was able to walk for approximately 10 minutes without a stick, albeit at a slow speed. Limitations in the passive motion of her bilateral hip joint were observed thus: flexion, 100°, internal rotation 5°, external rotation 15°, and abduction 20°, on both sides. She was able to perform a straight-leg raise of the right limb with substantial pain. The neurovascular status of both lower extremities was intact. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association scoring system for the evaluation of hip-joint function (JOA hip score) was 46 points for her right hip and 56 points for her left hip. The score was based on a total of 100 points, comprising 40 for pain, 20 for range of motion, 20 for the ability to walk, and 20 for activities of daily living [].\nStandard radiographs of both hips (Fig. a–c) demonstrated no characteristic findings such as the crescent sign, sclerotic band pattern, and collapse of the femoral head, and no joint space narrowing was seen in either femoral head. MRI of both hips (Fig. d, e) presented a low signal line in the subchondral region of the femoral head in the T1 weighted image and high signal region in almost all of the femoral head in the short tau inversion recovery (STIR). The oblique axial views of the proton density-weighted image showed a low-signal sinuous line in the anteromedial region of the femoral head (Fig. ). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) values were low in both femoral necks. Bone mineral density was 0.909 g/cm2 (T-score –0.9, Z-score −0.8) in the lumbar spine, 0.594 g/cm2 (T-score −1.8, Z-score −1.4) in the right femoral neck, and 0.529 g/cm2 (T-score −2.4, Z-score −2.0) in the left femoral neck. Laboratory findings were as follows: C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.03 mg/dl (normal range: 0–0.5 mg/dl); alkaline phosphatase 608 IU/l (40–150 IU/l); calcium 9.0 mg/dl (8.4–10.2 mg/dl); albumin 4.4 g/d (3.9–4.9 g/d); and hemoglobin 9.7 g/dl (12–16 g/dl). Bone turnover markers were as follows: tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP-5b) 463 mU/dl (premenopausal normal range: 120–420 mU/dl) and total procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (Total P1NP) 72.7 ng/ml (26.4–98.2 ng/ml). We diagnosed bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head and classified it as stage 1 in both femoral heads, according to the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) classification [].\nThe patient was instructed not to take as much weight as possible using sticks on the right side. Her symptoms improved immediately. However, 6 months later, her symptoms increased slightly without any traumatic episodes. Radiographic findings indicated almost no change (Fig. a–c). However, a slight signal change in the medial subcapital region was observed in the MRI scan (Fig. d, e). Her pain gradually increased thereafter, and 10 months after her first visit, walking became difficult. The JOA hip score decreased to 34 points in both hips; still, no changes could be observed in the radiograph (Fig. a–c). MRI of both hips showed a nondisplaced subcapital fracture on the medial side of both femoral necks, with bone marrow edema around the fracture (Fig. d, e). Because the cause of the fractures was not identified, the DEXA and bone turnover markers were measured again, and 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D was measured for the first time. All DEXA values decreased. The bone mineral density was 0.849 g/cm2 (T-score −1.5, Z-score −1.2) in the lumbar spine, 0.527 g/ cm2 (T-score −2.4, Z-score −2.1) in the right femoral neck, and 0.490 g/cm2 (T-score −2.7, Z-score −2.4) in the left femoral neck. TRACP-5b level increased to 607 mU/dl, and total P1NP decreased to 52.7 ng/ml. Her 25(OH) vitamin D level was 11.1 ng/dL and she was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. Based on the above results, our diagnosis was bilateral stress fracture of the femoral neck secondary to osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The patient underwent internal fixation of both hips with sliding hip screws (Dual SC screw system; Kisco, Kobe, Japan) to stabilize the stress fractures.

On admission, his weight was 37.3 kg (BMI = 11.6). His blood pressure was initially un-recordable but subsequently was recorded to be 104/72 mmHg. His capillary blood glucose level was 4.7 mmol/L, and his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15/15. On examination, he was noted to be severely malnourished and cachexic. The rest of the clinical examination was normal. LFTs were very abnormal, as shown in Table .Since admission, he seemed to lack insight. Due to problems keeping him compliant with medication and intravenous glucose, he had a number of hypoglycaemic events in the first two days of admission. The following day, he was deemed not to have the capacity. He underwent Mental Capacity Assessment and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards. He was ultimately placed under Mental Health Act 5(2) and was started on nasogastric feeding. His liver enzymes worsened further after the introduction of nasogastric feeding, but we were reassured by a normal non-invasive liver screen and ultrasound.His condition, liver tests, and liver synthetic function improved over the course of his 24-day admission (Table ), but his stay was associated with difficult behaviour.

      "clinical_note": "An 88-year-old woman (height, 150 cm; weight, 41 kg) with no history of drug allergy or general anesthesia was scheduled for transfemoral TAVI because of severe aortic stenosis (AS). The surgery was performed under general anesthesia to facilitate the use of transesophageal echocardiography and to manage any intraoperative complications. She was taking 0.625 mg/day bisoprolol, a selective β-1 blocker, for hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation. Additionally, she was taking amlodipine for hypertension. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography showed severe AS (aortic valve peak flow velocity: 4.73 m/s; mean aortic valve pressure gradient: 47 mmHg; aortic valve area: 0.41 cm2) and myocardial hypertrophy (left ventricular posterior wall thickness and interventricular septum thickness: 14 mm).\nPre-anesthetic medication for sedation was not administered. She received bisoprolol and amlodipine 3 h before entering the operating room. Figure shows the anesthesia record. General anesthesia was induced using midazolam and remifentanil; additionally, rocuronium was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation. She received total intravenous anesthesia: continuous infusions of propofol and remifentanil. Noradrenaline and dopamine were infused continuously through the central venous catheter to maintain blood pressure. AS disappeared after valve implantation. During the surgery, complete atrioventricular block occurred, and ventricular pacing (VVI mode: 60 ppm) was initiated. No other complications were associated with the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, she received 100 mg sugammadex through the central venous catheter, but 2 min later, her systolic arterial blood pressure (ABP) decreased unexpectedly to less than 40 mmHg. Simultaneously, ventilator monitoring revealed elevated peak and plateau airway pressures (60 and 40 cmH2O, respectively). No skin rash was observed on the body surface. Transthoracic echocardiography showed underfilling of the left ventricle without right ventricular dilatation or pericardial effusion. No abnormalities were observed in left ventricular wall motion.\nThe patient developed distributive shock, which was clinically diagnosed as anaphylactic shock caused by sugammadex because of the rapid onset of severe hypotension and bronchospasm. First, two boluses of 0.05 mg adrenaline were administered through the central venous catheter, followed by rapid volume resuscitation using crystalloid (1 L infusion within 30 min). The dose of noradrenaline was increased to 0.3 μg/kg/min. Consequently, the airway pressures returned to the original level, but the hypotension persisted. Thereafter, adrenaline was administered via bolus (0.1 mg twice) and continuous infusion (0.1 μg/kg/min); however, the increase in her ABP was minimal. Therefore, 1 mg glucagon was administered intravenously, and her systolic ABP immediately rose to 130 mmHg. An erythematous rash also appeared on her neck with the increase in ABP. Her general condition was stable after the therapeutic interventions. Ventricular pacing was continued because bradycardia with complete atrioventricular block was persistent during the interventions. She was admitted to the intensive care unit under tracheal intubation. Subsequently, the continuous infusion of adrenaline was discontinued, and the continuous infusion of noradrenaline was reduced. We also administered 125 mg methylprednisolone for 3 days. She was extubated 9 h after the onset of anaphylaxis, and circulatory agonists were discontinued the following day. She was discharged without complications on postoperative day 9. Blood tests revealed a total serum tryptase level of 7.3 ng/mL and 1.2 ng/mL at 1 h and 24 h after onset, respectively. We advised the patient to undergo allergy tests, such as skin prick tests or intradermal tests, to identify the cause of anaphylaxis.

      "clinical_note": "An 88-year-old woman (height, 150 cm; weight, 41 kg) with no history of drug allergy or general anesthesia was scheduled for transfemoral TAVI because of severe aortic stenosis (AS). The surgery was performed under general anesthesia to facilitate the use of transesophageal echocardiography and to manage any intraoperative complications. She was taking 0.625 mg/day bisoprolol, a selective β-1 blocker, for hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation. Additionally, she was taking amlodipine for hypertension. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography showed severe AS (aortic valve peak flow velocity: 4.73 m/s; mean aortic valve pressure gradient: 47 mmHg; aortic valve area: 0.41 cm2) and myocardial hypertrophy (left ventricular posterior wall thickness and interventricular septum thickness: 14 mm).\nPre-anesthetic medication for sedation was not administered. She received bisoprolol and amlodipine 3 h before entering the operating room. Figure shows the anesthesia record. General anesthesia was induced using midazolam and remifentanil; additionally, rocuronium was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation. She received total intravenous anesthesia: continuous infusions of propofol and remifentanil. Noradrenaline and dopamine were infused continuously through the central venous catheter to maintain blood pressure. AS disappeared after valve implantation. During the surgery, complete atrioventricular block occurred, and ventricular pacing (VVI mode: 60 ppm) was initiated. No other complications were associated with the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, she received 100 mg sugammadex through the central venous catheter, but 2 min later, her systolic arterial blood pressure (ABP) decreased unexpectedly to less than 40 mmHg. Simultaneously, ventilator monitoring revealed elevated peak and plateau airway pressures (60 and 40 cmH2O, respectively). No skin rash was observed on the body surface. Transthoracic echocardiography showed underfilling of the left ventricle without right ventricular dilatation or pericardial effusion. No abnormalities were observed in left ventricular wall motion.\nThe patient developed distributive shock, which was clinically diagnosed as anaphylactic shock caused by sugammadex because of the rapid onset of severe hypotension and bronchospasm. First, two boluses of 0.05 mg adrenaline were administered through the central venous catheter, followed by rapid volume resuscitation using crystalloid (1 L infusion within 30 min). The dose of noradrenaline was increased to 0.3 μg/kg/min. Consequently, the airway pressures returned to the original level, but the hypotension persisted. Thereafter, adrenaline was administered via bolus (0.1 mg twice) and continuous infusion (0.1 μg/kg/min); however, the increase in her ABP was minimal. Therefore, 1 mg glucagon was administered intravenously, and her systolic ABP immediately rose to 130 mmHg. An erythematous rash also appeared on her neck with the increase in ABP. Her general condition was stable after the therapeutic interventions. Ventricular pacing was continued because bradycardia with complete atrioventricular block was persistent during the interventions. She was admitted to the intensive care unit under tracheal intubation. Subsequently, the continuous infusion of adrenaline was discontinued, and the continuous infusion of noradrenaline was reduced. We also administered 125 mg methylprednisolone for 3 days. She was extubated 9 h after the onset of anaphylaxis, and circulatory agonists were discontinued the following day. She was discharged without complications on postoperative day 9. Blood tests revealed a total serum tryptase level of 7.3 ng/mL and 1.2 ng/mL at 1 h and 24 h after onset, respectively. We advised the patient to undergo allergy tests, such as skin prick tests or intradermal tests, to identify the cause of anaphylaxis. However, the patient refused these tests because she was elderly and unlikely to undergo surgery under general anesthesia in the future.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.

      "clinical_note": "An 88-year-old woman (height, 150 cm; weight, 41 kg) with no history of drug allergy or general anesthesia was scheduled for transfemoral TAVI because of severe aortic stenosis (AS). The surgery was performed under general anesthesia to facilitate the use of transesophageal echocardiography and to manage any intraoperative complications. She was taking 0.625 mg/day bisoprolol, a selective β-1 blocker, for hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation. Additionally, she was taking amlodipine for hypertension. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography showed severe AS (aortic valve peak flow velocity: 4.73 m/s; mean aortic valve pressure gradient: 47 mmHg; aortic valve area: 0.41 cm2) and myocardial hypertrophy (left ventricular posterior wall thickness and interventricular septum thickness: 14 mm).\nPre-anesthetic medication for sedation was not administered. She received bisoprolol and amlodipine 3 h before entering the operating room. Figure shows the anesthesia record. General anesthesia was induced using midazolam and remifentanil; additionally, rocuronium was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation. She received total intravenous anesthesia: continuous infusions of propofol and remifentanil. Noradrenaline and dopamine were infused continuously through the central venous catheter to maintain blood pressure. AS disappeared after valve implantation. During the surgery, complete atrioventricular block occurred, and ventricular pacing (VVI mode: 60 ppm) was initiated. No other complications were associated with the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, she received 100 mg sugammadex through the central venous catheter, but 2 min later, her systolic arterial blood pressure (ABP) decreased unexpectedly to less than 40 mmHg. Simultaneously, ventilator monitoring revealed elevated peak and plateau airway pressures (60 and 40 cmH2O, respectively). No skin rash was observed on the body surface. Transthoracic echocardiography showed underfilling of the left ventricle without right ventricular dilatation or pericardial effusion. No abnormalities were observed in left ventricular wall motion.\nThe patient developed distributive shock, which was clinically diagnosed as anaphylactic shock caused by sugammadex because of the rapid onset of severe hypotension and bronchospasm. First, two boluses of 0.05 mg adrenaline were administered through the central venous catheter, followed by rapid volume resuscitation using crystalloid (1 L infusion within 30 min). The dose of noradrenaline was increased to 0.3 μg/kg/min. Consequently, the airway pressures returned to the original level, but the hypotension persisted. Thereafter, adrenaline was administered via bolus (0.1 mg twice) and continuous infusion (0.1 μg/kg/min); however, the increase in her ABP was minimal. Therefore, 1 mg glucagon was administered intravenously, and her systolic ABP immediately rose to 130 mmHg. An erythematous rash also appeared on her neck with the increase in ABP. Her general condition was stable after the therapeutic interventions. Ventricular pacing was continued because bradycardia with complete atrioventricular block was persistent during the interventions. She was admitted to the intensive care unit under tracheal intubation. Subsequently, the continuous infusion of adrenaline was discontinued, and the continuous infusion of noradrenaline was reduced. We also administered 125 mg methylprednisolone for 3 days. She was extubated 9 h after the onset of anaphylaxis, and circulatory agonists were discontinued the following day. She was discharged without complications on postoperative day 9. Blood tests revealed a total serum tryptase level of 7.3 ng/mL and 1.2 ng/mL at 1 h and 24 h after onset, respectively. We advised the patient to undergo allergy tests, such as skin prick tests or intradermal tests, to identify the cause of anaphylaxis. However, the patient refused these tests because she was elderly and unlikely to undergo surgery under general anesthesia in the future.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report. This report was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nagasaki University Hospital (Approval number: 21041932).",

      "question": "A 39-year-old male was admitted to the hospital due to a persistent fever, dry cough, and a declining general health condition. The patient was severely breathless even during minor physical activities and required 4 L/min of oxygen. His breathing pattern was rapid and shallow. After being educated about dyspnea-relieving positions, regular mobilization, and deep-breathing exercises, the patient's respiratory rate decreased and his oxygen saturation increased. Over the next few days, his dyspnea and anxiety began to improve. His therapy was transitioned to walking and strength training, and he was able to walk 350 m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before being discharged home. What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?",

The patient initially needed 4 L/min of oxygen, had a rapid and shallow breathing pattern at rest and became severely breathless during minor physical activities. In the beginning, physical therapy focused on patient education about dyspnea-relieving positions, the importance of regular mobilization, and deep-breathing exercises. However, it quickly became evident that his anxiety from fear of dying and worries about his future aggravated his dyspnea and vice versa. The patient was so dyspneic, anxious, and weak that he was barely able to walk to the toilet. To counter this vicious circle, the physical therapist actively listened to the patient, explained why he was experiencing breathlessness, and tested suitable positions to relieve his dyspnea. He seemed to benefit from the education and the relaxing breathing exercises, as seen on day 2, when his respiratory rate could be reduced from 30 breaths/min to 22 breaths/min and his oxygen saturation increased from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen after guiding him through some deep-breathing exercises. Over the next days, his dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate and he regained his self-confidence. Therapy was progressively shifted to walking and strength training and the patient rapidly advanced to walk 350 m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before his discharge home.",
