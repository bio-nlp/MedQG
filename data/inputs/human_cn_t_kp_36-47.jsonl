[{"clinical_note": "A 72-year-old male, known hypertensive on medication, non-smoker, no family history of cancer presented with complaints of pain in the right hip with difficulty in walking in January 2019. On evaluation, a pathological fracture was found at the neck of the right femur. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine was done, which revealed osteophyte complexes at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6 vertebrae causing narrowing of neural foramina. Multiple T2-hyperintense lesions in lung parenchyma were an incidental finding. Upon further evaluation with positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan of the whole body, mass in the apex of the right lung, right hilum, mediastinal lymph node, soft tissue wall thickening in the proximal stomach along with multiple liver and bone metastases were found. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy revealed a proximal gastric growth from which a biopsy was taken. Histopathology showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. A provisional diagnosis of carcinoma stomach with distant metastasis was reached. But immunohistochemistry came out to be positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and cytokeratin-7 (CK-7), while negative for cytokeratin 20 (CK-20) (Figures -).\nSo, a possibility of metastasis from a lung primary was considered. It was confirmed by a biopsy from the lung mass that revealed adenocarcinoma as the histopathology. On immunohistochemistry, it was positive for TTF-1 and CK-7 while negative for CK-20 and synaptophysin. Analysis for anaplastic lymphoma kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor, and receptor tyrosine kinase 1 were all negative but programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) was 90%. So, the final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma lung with multiple lung, liver, femur, as well as gastric metastases.\nFor the pathological fracture, he underwent fixation by intramedullary nailing followed by palliative external beam radiotherapy 8 Gy in a single fraction. He received 10 three-weekly cycles each of Inj. pembrolizumab 200 mg as intravenous infusion and Inj. denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously from March 2019 to September 2019. An interim PET-CT scan done after four cycles of immunotherapy in June 2019 showed a near-complete metabolic response (Figures -).\nAfter 10 cycles, Inj. pembrolizumab was discontinued as the patient was unwilling to continue due to personal reasons. He was then started with chemotherapy, Inj. pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and Inj. bevacizumab 15 mg/kg in October 2019. Following this, the patient developed grade 1 maculopapular rash, pedal edema, and grade 2 diarrhea, which were managed conservatively. After that the patient did not opt for the continuation of chemotherapy. The next visit of the patient was in February 2021 with complaints of cough and breathlessness. On re-evaluation with PET-CT scan, progressive disease was found in the primary site (Figures , ).\nPalliative radiotherapy of 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the primary lesion was delivered through anteroposterior and posteroanterior portals of 10 megavolt energy each in April 2021 via linear accelerator (Elekta-Versa HD) which was tolerated well (Figure ).\nIn June, the patient developed an altered sensorium and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of brain revealed multiple brain metastases for which the patient received palliative whole-brain radiotherapy of 30 Gy in 10 fractions over two weeks from the same linear accelerator.

Her right hip was more painful than her left hip. There was no history of trauma, alcohol abuse, or steroid use. Her medical history included iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed 2 years earlier, after which she had been on iron supplements. She had no fracture episodes, including fragility fractures.\nHer height, body weight, and body mass index were 155 cm, 42 kg, and 18.7 kg/m2, respectively. She was able to walk for approximately 10 minutes without a stick, albeit at a slow speed. Limitations in the passive motion of her bilateral hip joint were observed thus: flexion, 100\u00b0, internal rotation 5\u00b0, external rotation 15\u00b0, and abduction 20\u00b0, on both sides. She was able to perform a straight-leg raise of the right limb with substantial pain. The neurovascular status of both lower extremities was intact. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association scoring system for the evaluation of hip-joint function (JOA hip score) was 46 points for her right hip and 56 points for her left hip. The score was based on a total of 100 points, comprising 40 for pain, 20 for range of motion, 20 for the ability to walk, and 20 for activities of daily living [].\nStandard radiographs of both hips (Fig. a\u2013c) demonstrated no characteristic findings such as the crescent sign, sclerotic band pattern, and collapse of the femoral head, and no joint space narrowing was seen in either femoral head. MRI of both hips (Fig. d, e) presented a low signal line in the subchondral region of the femoral head in the T1 weighted image and high signal region in almost all of the femoral head in the short tau inversion recovery (STIR). The oblique axial views of the proton density-weighted image showed a low-signal sinuous line in the anteromedial region of the femoral head (Fig. ). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) values were low in both femoral necks. Bone mineral density was 0.909 g/cm2 (T-score \u20130.9, Z-score \u22120.8) in the lumbar spine, 0.594 g/cm2 (T-score \u22121.8, Z-score \u22121.4) in the right femoral neck, and 0.529 g/cm2 (T-score \u22122.4, Z-score \u22122.0) in the left femoral neck. Laboratory findings were as follows: C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.03 mg/dl (normal range: 0\u20130.5 mg/dl); alkaline phosphatase 608 IU/l (40\u2013150 IU/l); calcium 9.0 mg/dl (8.4\u201310.2 mg/dl); albumin 4.4 g/d (3.9\u20134.9 g/d); and hemoglobin 9.7 g/dl (12\u201316 g/dl). Bone turnover markers were as follows: tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP-5b) 463 mU/dl (premenopausal normal range: 120\u2013420 mU/dl) and total procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (Total P1NP) 72.7 ng/ml (26.4\u201398.2 ng/ml). We diagnosed bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head and classified it as stage 1 in both femoral heads, according to the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) classification [].\nThe patient was instructed not to take as much weight as possible using sticks on the right side. Her symptoms improved immediately. However, 6 months later, her symptoms increased slightly without any traumatic episodes. Radiographic findings indicated almost no change (Fig. a\u2013c). However, a slight signal change in the medial subcapital region was observed in the MRI scan (Fig. d, e). Her pain gradually increased thereafter, and 10 months after her first visit, walking became difficult. The JOA hip score decreased to 34 points in both hips; still, no changes could be observed in the radiograph (Fig. a\u2013c). MRI of both hips showed a nondisplaced subcapital fracture on the medial side of both femoral necks, with bone marrow edema around the fracture (Fig. d, e). Because the cause of the fractures was not identified, the DEXA and bone turnover markers were measured again, and 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D was measured for the first time. All DEXA values decreased. The bone mineral density was 0.849 g/cm2 (T-score \u22121.5, Z-score \u22121.2) in the lumbar spine, 0.527 g/ cm2 (T-score \u22122.4, Z-score \u22122.1) in the right femoral neck, and 0.490 g/cm2 (T-score \u22122.7, Z-score \u22122.4) in the left femoral neck. TRACP-5b level increased to 607 mU/dl, and total P1NP decreased to 52.7 ng/ml. Her 25(OH) vitamin D level was 11.1 ng/dL and she was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. Based on the above results, our diagnosis was bilateral stress fracture of the femoral neck secondary to osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The patient underwent internal fixation of both hips with sliding hip screws (Dual SC screw system; Kisco, Kobe, Japan) to stabilize the stress fractures. In addition, the reaming performed before inserting of the sliding hip screw served as core decompression for the femoral heads [, ]. The specimens obtained from the reaming were examined histologically. Definitive findings of osteonecrosis such as bone marrow necrosis and loss of osteocyte nuclei in the femoral heads were observed (Fig. ). Postoperative radiographs showed no evidence of displacement of the fractures (Fig. ). We administered eldecalcitol 0.75 \u03bcg per day orally for vitamin D deficiency, and daily subcutaneous injections of teriparatide acetate. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient began to bear weight as tolerated with the use of an assistive device bilaterally. One month postoperatively, she was able to walk without pain and used a cane part time. She eventually regained full walking ability without a cane 3 months after surgery. Furthermore, her JOA hip score improved to 90 points in both hip joints at 5 months after surgery.

In addition, the reaming performed before inserting of the sliding hip screw served as core decompression for the femoral heads [, ]. The specimens obtained from the reaming were examined histologically. Definitive findings of osteonecrosis such as bone marrow necrosis and loss of osteocyte nuclei in the femoral heads were observed (Fig. ). Postoperative radiographs showed no evidence of displacement of the fractures (Fig. ). We administered eldecalcitol 0.75 \u03bcg per day orally for vitamin D deficiency, and daily subcutaneous injections of teriparatide acetate. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient began to bear weight as tolerated with the use of an assistive device bilaterally. One month postoperatively, she was able to walk without pain and used a cane part time. She eventually regained full walking ability without a cane 3 months after surgery. Furthermore, her JOA hip score improved to 90 points in both hip joints at 5 months after surgery. Radiographs showed no evidence of recurrent stress fracture in the femoral neck or progression of osteonecrosis (Fig. ).

She had no fracture episodes, including fragility fractures.\nHer height, body weight, and body mass index were 155 cm, 42 kg, and 18.7 kg/m2, respectively. She was able to walk for approximately 10 minutes without a stick, albeit at a slow speed. Limitations in the passive motion of her bilateral hip joint were observed thus: flexion, 100\u00b0, internal rotation 5\u00b0, external rotation 15\u00b0, and abduction 20\u00b0, on both sides. She was able to perform a straight-leg raise of the right limb with substantial pain. The neurovascular status of both lower extremities was intact. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association scoring system for the evaluation of hip-joint function (JOA hip score) was 46 points for her right hip and 56 points for her left hip.

We diagnosed bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head and classified it as stage 1 in both femoral heads, according to the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) classification [].\nThe patient was instructed not to take as much weight as possible using sticks on the right side. Her symptoms improved immediately. However, 6 months later, her symptoms increased slightly without any traumatic episodes. Radiographic findings indicated almost no change (Fig. a\u2013c). However, a slight signal change in the medial subcapital region was observed in the MRI scan (Fig. d, e). Her pain gradually increased thereafter, and 10 months after her first visit, walking became difficult. The JOA hip score decreased to 34 points in both hips; still, no changes could be observed in the radiograph (Fig. a\u2013c). MRI of both hips showed a nondisplaced subcapital fracture on the medial side of both femoral necks, with bone marrow edema around the fracture (Fig. d, e). Because the cause of the fractures was not identified, the DEXA and bone turnover markers were measured again, and 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D was measured for the first time. All DEXA values decreased. The bone mineral density was 0.849 g/cm2 (T-score \u22121.5, Z-score \u22121.2) in the lumbar spine, 0.527 g/ cm2 (T-score \u22122.4, Z-score \u22122.1) in the right femoral neck, and 0.490 g/cm2 (T-score \u22122.7, Z-score \u22122.4) in the left femoral neck. TRACP-5b level increased to 607 mU/dl, and total P1NP decreased to 52.7 ng/ml. Her 25(OH) vitamin D level was 11.1 ng/dL and she was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. Based on the above results, our diagnosis was bilateral stress fracture of the femoral neck secondary to osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The patient underwent internal fixation of both hips with sliding hip screws (Dual SC screw system; Kisco, Kobe, Japan) to stabilize the stress fractures. In addition, the reaming performed before inserting of the sliding hip screw served as core decompression for the femoral heads [, ]. The specimens obtained from the reaming were examined histologically. Definitive findings of osteonecrosis such as bone marrow necrosis and loss of osteocyte nuclei in the femoral heads were observed (Fig. ). Postoperative radiographs showed no evidence of displacement of the fractures (Fig. ). We administered eldecalcitol 0.75 \u03bcg per day orally for vitamin D deficiency, and daily subcutaneous injections of teriparatide acetate. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient began to bear weight as tolerated with the use of an assistive device bilaterally. One month postoperatively, she was able to walk without pain and used a cane part time. She eventually regained full walking ability without a cane 3 months after surgery. Furthermore, her JOA hip score improved to 90 points in both hip joints at 5 months after surgery. Radiographs showed no evidence of recurrent stress fracture in the femoral neck or progression of osteonecrosis (Fig. ).

IHC results of an endoscopic biopsy specimen of the bronchial mucosa on the upper left lobe showed the positive expression of TTF1, CK7, NapsinA, Ki67, CK, and EMA, and the negative expression of CK5/6, P40, CgA, Syn, and CD45 on 6 September 2019. Histopathologic observations showed infiltration of atypia cells in mucosal and fibrous tissues. The detection tools of pathology and cytology included automatic IHC staining (BenchMark XT, Roche, The United States), digital slice scanner, image analysis software (Pannoramic 250, 3DHistech, Hungary), and microscope (Eclipse Ci-S, Nikon, Japan). Finally, the patient was diagnosed with stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma combing with bone metastases.\nTo seek potential therapeutic opportunities, the FFPE tissue and control sample (white blood cell) of the patient were detected using a 733-gene NGS panel in a College of American Pathologists (CAP) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certificated lab. Sequencing reads were mapped against the hg19/GRCh37 genome, and duplicate reads were removed, followed by variants calling in targeted regions using an in-house developed bioinformatics algorithm. The algorithm utilized a filtering model containing background error correction, strand bias, base quality, mapping quality, short tandem repeat regions, and low-quality mapping ratio 25 []. The NGS analysis results indicated that the patient had an EGFR exon 19 p.L747_S752del somatic mutation with an allelic fraction of 73.19% and TP53 p.H179L germline mutation. Besides, the whole chromosome 7 and 5q deletion were detected using NGS-based copy number variation (CNV) analyses (Fig. ), which were classical abnormalities associated with MDS. According to the clinical inquiry, the patient was a farmer by occupation, which means that he has long been exposed to certain chemicals such as pesticides, fertilizers, and solvents containing benzene. In addition, he smoked for 40 years. Taking all these findings together, we suspected the patient with secondary MDS. The results of the physiological blood indexes and the bone marrow aspiration test showed a decrease of platelet counts and the elevation of myelocyte counts. The proportion of blast was 5%, and the morphology of the cells presented the characteristics of MDS, which further confirmed our speculation (Fig. and Additional file : Fig. S1).\nIn terms of treatment, the EGFR-positive mutation patient was administered with gefitinib starting from 20 August 2019. Due to decreasing platelet counts, azacitidine was administrated for four courses of treatment. However, the thrombocytopenia had not been significantly improved, and the size of the maximal tumor in the lung lesion did not decrease after seven months\u2019 treatment (Fig. B). On 10 April 2020, a pathological report showed the infiltration of poorly differentiated cancer cells into the fibrous tissue. IHC results suggested the neuroendocrine tumor, in which small cell carcinoma and atypical carcinoid tumor accounted for about 40% and 60%, respectively.

Since at that time, there were no clinical signs of thrombosis, the diagnosis of ATD did not lead to any therapeutic consequences. Screening for ATD at this early age had been carried out on parental request, as his mother was diagnosed with ATD in her early adulthood.

There is no family history of cancer or other pathologies of interest.\nIn February 2020, he presented dysesthesias in the right hemithorax associated with pain and a mass-like sensation in the same region. This prompted a visit to his local healthcare center (part of the public health network) where a chest CT scan was ordered in March 2020 revealing a solitary pulmonary mass located in the right inferior lobule with an invasion of both the pleura and thoracic wall. However, due to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ecuador, all further studies were suspended for two to three months, resulting in a significant delay of the biopsy, which was undertaken on May 17, 2020.

The study revealed a mass on the right lobe of the cerebellum (2.66 x 2.61 x 2.48cm) with perilesional edema, compressing the fourth ventricle. A progression of his primary lung cancer was diagnosed, the original chemotherapy regimen was suspended and replaced with adjuvant Temozolomide maintenance therapy, and he is referred to the radiotherapy service for WBRT with 20 Gy divided into five fractions, which improved his symptoms.\nHowever, in March 2021, the patient comes to our hospital\u2019s radiotherapy department to request a second opinion due to the reappearance of his neurological symptoms (loss of balance, headaches, nausea, dizziness, and photophobia). The physical examination is relevant for a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, oriented in time, place, and person, incapacitating ataxic gait (the patient needs to be mobilized in a wheelchair), and severe photophobia requiring the constant use of sunglasses. The rest of the neurological examination is normal including cranial nerves, reflexes, and somatosensory function. Relevant prognostic indexes were calculated and included the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) of 80%, and the Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA), specific for patients with brain metastasis, of 3. A CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis was obtained, on February 22, 2021, in order to detect any new tumoral or metastatic activity; however, none was found (Figures -). Therefore, a follow-up MRI was ordered on February 23, 2021, which revealed two intra-axial lesions on the right cerebellar hemisphere and near the right lateral ventricle, respectively (Figures -).\nDue to the aforementioned clinical and imaging findings, radio-surgical management of the disease with 21Gy, in one fraction, delivered with a linear particle accelerator (LINAC), TrueBeam\u00ae (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was offered to the patient; immobilization was performed with a thermoplastic mask and Precise Bite mouthpiece (Solstice\u2122 SRS Immobilization System, Orange City, IA); treatment simulation was done on the CT images and volume definition was performed in the contrasted T1 MRI with SPACE sequence; Gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined as the signal enhancing hyperintense tumoral regions observed on MRI and planning target volume (PTV) was prolonged 1mm in all directions. Dosimetric planning was based on HyperArc (Varian Medical System) which is a relatively new isocentric VMAT technique developed specifically for non-coplanar, multileaf collimator (MLC)-based stereotactic radiotherapy with automated treatment optimization and dose delivery; the clinical and dosimetric planning can be found in Figures -. Dosage and organ constraints, evaluation of the iso-dosage curve goals as well as the evaluation of the Paddick index were performed in accordance with published guidelines [,].

Tomographic images obtained with the Cone Beam CT system, integrated into the LINAC, showed a complete (100%) correlation of the images obtained during simulation and planning. Finally, the effective time of treatment was of four minutes.\nTreatment was delayed as per the patient\u2019s request for more time to consider and on April 5, 2021, the procedure was finally performed without complications and in an outpatient setting. A follow-up was programmed 15 days after treatment at which the patient presented significant clinical improvement (absence of headaches, nausea, dizziness, photophobia, and normal balance and gait). There was no evidence of radiation toxicity, and the cognitive function was normal. A control MRI on July 17, 2021, showed a clear reduction in the size of both lesions as well as complete resolution of the mass effect produced by the cerebellar mass; a comparison of the pre- and post-treatment scans can be found in Figures -.\nAt the moment, the patient remains in continuous follow-up, with the last reported telephonic follow-up, on September 2, 2021, in which the patient reported being asymptomatic and carrying out all of his regular day-to-day activities without any limitations.", "topic": "Selecting Clinical Interventions (Mixed Management)", "keypoint": "radiation therapy"}, {"clinical_note": "The patient is a 68-year-old retired male, born in Aloag and resident of Tambillo (a rural locality in the vicinity of the capital of Ecuador, Quito).

A progression of his primary lung cancer was diagnosed, the original chemotherapy regimen was suspended and replaced with adjuvant Temozolomide maintenance therapy, and he is referred to the radiotherapy service for WBRT with 20 Gy divided into five fractions, which improved his symptoms.\nHowever, in March 2021, the patient comes to our hospital\u2019s radiotherapy department to request a second opinion due to the reappearance of his neurological symptoms (loss of balance, headaches, nausea, dizziness, and photophobia). The physical examination is relevant for a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, oriented in time, place, and person, incapacitating ataxic gait (the patient needs to be mobilized in a wheelchair), and severe photophobia requiring the constant use of sunglasses. The rest of the neurological examination is normal including cranial nerves, reflexes, and somatosensory function. Relevant prognostic indexes were calculated and included the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) of 80%, and the Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA), specific for patients with brain metastasis, of 3. A CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis was obtained, on February 22, 2021, in order to detect any new tumoral or metastatic activity; however, none was found (Figures -). Therefore, a follow-up MRI was ordered on February 23, 2021, which revealed two intra-axial lesions on the right cerebellar hemisphere and near the right lateral ventricle, respectively (Figures -).\nDue to the aforementioned clinical and imaging findings, radio-surgical management of the disease with 21Gy, in one fraction, delivered with a linear particle accelerator (LINAC), TrueBeam\u00ae (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was offered to the patient; immobilization was performed with a thermoplastic mask and Precise Bite mouthpiece (Solstice\u2122 SRS Immobilization System, Orange City, IA); treatment simulation was done on the CT images and volume definition was performed in the contrasted T1 MRI with SPACE sequence; Gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined as the signal enhancing hyperintense tumoral regions observed on MRI and planning target volume (PTV) was prolonged 1mm in all directions. Dosimetric planning was based on HyperArc (Varian Medical System) which is a relatively new isocentric VMAT technique developed specifically for non-coplanar, multileaf collimator (MLC)-based stereotactic radiotherapy with automated treatment optimization and dose delivery; the clinical and dosimetric planning can be found in Figures -. Dosage and organ constraints, evaluation of the iso-dosage curve goals as well as the evaluation of the Paddick index were performed in accordance with published guidelines [,]. Before treatment, we administer a 16mg intramuscular deposit dexamethasone injection in order to reduce the risk of cerebellar tonsil herniation due to the important edema from the cerebellar metastasis. Tomographic images obtained with the Cone Beam CT system, integrated into the LINAC, showed a complete (100%) correlation of the images obtained during simulation and planning. Finally, the effective time of treatment was of four minutes.\nTreatment was delayed as per the patient\u2019s request for more time to consider and on April 5, 2021, the procedure was finally performed without complications and in an outpatient setting. A follow-up was programmed 15 days after treatment at which the patient presented significant clinical improvement (absence of headaches, nausea, dizziness, photophobia, and normal balance and gait). There was no evidence of radiation toxicity, and the cognitive function was normal.

The abdominal CT scan showed a 25 \u00d7 22 mm well-defined rounded focal lesion with a smooth outline, at the level of the right adrenal gland with homogeneous attenuation, HU-7 on a noncontrast scan, and no evidence of local tissue invasion (Fig. ). The left adrenal gland and ovaries were normal.\nBrain magnetic resonance imaging was done to exclude a central cause of precocious puberty and was normal. Complete hemogram, liver, and renal functions were normal.\nA diagnosis of an estrogen-secreting right adrenocortical tumor was made, and we referred the patient to surgery.\nDuring laparotomy a 3 cm diameter tumor in the right adrenal gland was completely excised. The histopathological examination showed well-circumscribed tumor forming nests with trabeculae and sheets of polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumor was not infiltrating the capsule, with no mitosis, atypia, or necrosis (Wieneke index score = 0). Findings suggestive of benign adrenal cortical adenoma.\nThe postoperative evaluation revealed normal cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Estradiol E2 40 pg/mL was consistent with secondary central precocious puberty, so the patient was started on monthly gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist, with a regular follow-up plan for the possibility of recurrence of adrenal adenoma.\nSix months after the operation, the patient was well and compliant to monthly gonadotrophin agonist injections. She showed partial regression of her secondary sexual characters and a growth velocity of 5 cm/year.
