[{"clinical_note": "A healthy 11-year-old girl was presented to the National University of Malaysia (UKM) Paediatric Dental Clinic with a referral for further management of pulp necrosis of an immature lower right second premolar (tooth 45), secondary to the fractured tubercle of dens evaginatus. Two weeks earlier, she had treatment at a general dental clinic for pain related to tooth 45. Tooth 45 had spontaneous and lingering pain following cold and thermal stimuli. The tooth was diagnosed to have symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, and root canal therapy was initiated. The canal was accessed, and pulp extirpation performed before the placement of intracanal nonsetting calcium hydroxide by the general dental practitioner (GDP).\nAt the time of current assessment, her tooth-related symptoms had completely resolved. General oral examination showed the presence of generalised mild gingivitis with a basic periodontal examination (BPE) score of 1 in all sextants. The patient's oral hygiene was fair with a plaque score of 30%. The patient is still in her mixed dentition with the presence of the primary maxillary canines. Her upper dental arch was well aligned, and mild crowding of anterior teeth was noted in the lower arch. Tooth 45 has an occlusal glass ionomer dressing of the access cavity made for the pulp extirpation earlier by the GDP (). Cold and electric pulp sensibility testings showed positive responses to all fully erupted premolars indicative of tooth vitality expect for tooth 45. Tooth 45 also has slight tenderness to percussion. Periapical radiograph of tooth 45 showed an immature root with convergent open apex and small periapical radiolucency. The pulp space of tooth 45 is of an even width from the coronal to the apical portion (). Based on the assessments, tooth 45 was diagnosed with pulp necrosis secondary to fractured dens evaginatus and symptomatic apical periodontitis.\nOn the day of initial assessment, tooth 45 was isolated with rubber dam after infiltration of local anaesthetic solution (2% lidocaine with 1 : 80000 adrenaline). Pulp chamber was reentered through the previously prepared access cavity. The root canal was exposed and irrigated with saline. After that, the canal was dried with paper points and the tooth working length was estimated with a K-file No. 60. A working length, 2 mm short of the apical opening, was determined (17 mm). The canal was gently prepared with the K-file No. 60 and then irrigated with a copious volume of 1.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCI). After drying the wet canal with paper points, nonsetting calcium hydroxide was placed into the canal and the access cavity was double sealed with Cavit\u2122 3M, USA, and glass ionomer cement (GIC) (Riva Self Cure\u2122 SDI, Australia).\nTwo weeks later, the tooth was reassessed for any signs and symptoms of infection. The tooth was no longer tender to percussion, and there was no indication of infection-related signs and symptoms. After isolation with a rubber dam, the root canal of tooth 45 was reaccessed and irrigated with a copious volume 1.5% NaOCl to remove the nonsetting calcium hydroxide. Then, the canal was irrigated with sterile water and dried with paper points. Subsequently, the canal was irrigated with 17% EDTA (Pulpdent\u2122, Watertown, Massachusetts) for a minute and dried with paper points. Finally, under the guidance of a dental operating microscope (Carl Zeiss Surgical GmbH, S100), the apical region was filled using the EndoSequence (BC RRM-Fast Set Putty, Brasseler, USA) material up to 4 mm thickness to create an apical seal (). The orifice of the root canal was double sealed with a cotton pellet, temporary filling material (Cavit 3M, USA), and GIC (Riva Self Cure SDI, Australia).\nOnce again, the root canal was reaccessed two weeks later, irrigated with 1.5% NaOCl, and dried with paper points. Next, the dried canal was obturated with thermoplasticised gutta-perca using the Obtura III Max System (Obtura Spartan\u00ae Endodontics) (). After that, the access cavity was double sealed with GIC (Riva Self Cure SDI, Australia) and nanohybrid composite (AURA\u2122 SDI, Australia), respectively.\nFollowing the obturation, tooth 45 was reviewed at three-month and six-month intervals. During both reviews, tooth 45 was asymptomatic. However, at the six-month review, a periapical radiograph of tooth 45 showed an unexpected finding. The apical root of tooth 45 continued to grow beyond the apexification level with a normal periodontal ligament space and lamina dura. No evidence of periapical radiolucency was noted ().

An ankle malleolar fracture was fixed by the locking plate and cannulated cancellous screws with direct lateral and medial approach. He had finally consulted us because of worsening ankle pain while walking. On physical examination, there was tenderness in the anteromedial joint space of the right ankle. Slight ankle swelling was noted. Dorsiflexion of the right ankle was 10\u00b0, similar to that of the left ankle, but plantarflexion was restricted to 38\u00b0, compared with 60\u00b0 on the left, but the ankle instability test was negative.\nThe first three months, even though we performed intra-articular injections, arthroscopic synovectomy for osteoarthritis, and the fixation implant removal in order to release implant irritation, his ankle pain persisted.\nThe AOFAS ankle score at that point in time was 50 . Radiographs showed moderate narrowing of the ankle joint and forward displacement of the talus (-A, B). Computed tomography of the right ankle showed an osteochondral defect on the anterolateral surface of the distal tibial plafond (). This was diagnosed as progressive osteoarthritis caused by an osteochondral defect on the anterolateral surface of the distal tibial plafond, and surgical repair of the osteochondral defect was recommended. Three months later, the osteochondral graft was performed on the patient's right ankle. The patient was placed in the supine position under general anesthesia. The lower extremity was prepared and draped in the standard sterile fashion. We inserted the 2.0 mm K-wire in his right calcaneus, then skeletal traction was done in order to open his right ankle joint space if necessary. Next, 10 mL of fluid was injected intra-articularly to distend the ankle. The anterolateral ankle arthroscopy portal was established in the routine fashion, and global arthroscopy was performed. The osteochondral defect was identified about the anterolateral plafond which site was enthesis of the anterior tibiofibular ligament (), and osteochondral lesions of the tibia and talus were identified. An anteromedial portal was established. The osteochondral lesions were probed, and the osteochondral lesions were diagnosed as grade 2 according to the classification of the International Cartilage Repair Society . We performed multiple OAT in the anterolateral plafond at the anterolateral wall with extension of the anterolateral portal. The anterolateral osteochondral defect was measured 9 mm \u00d7 20 mm ().

Then, the dilator was interpositioned into the recipient site, and a radiograph was taken to calculate the inclination angle between the dilator and tibial plafond. Therefore, we thought that the smooth surface was obtained by the inclination of the grafted plugs. According to the angle required, two 8-mm osteochondral autograft plugs ramped 35\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 were harvested from the donor site (), and transferred into the anterolateral plafond at an angle to re-contour the articular surface and make it smooth. Both harvest and transplantation of osteochondral autograft plugs were performed by open approaches for transplantation in the exact slope. After this procedure, the surface of the anterolateral wall of plafond was almost completely smooth (). The depth of these plugs was 20 mm, deeper than the osteochondral defect. It was confirmed that the deepest area of the plugs consisted of a macroscopically normal bone. We used press-fit technique in order to stabilize the osteochondral plugs. Stabilization of the osteochondral fragments relied on tight interference with the host bone. In case of difficulty with press-fit technique, a screw made of polylactic acid and hydroxyapatite was prepared, but it was never used.\nPostoperatively, the foot was placed in a short leg cast, and the patient was advised to ambulate non-weightbearing for a 4-week period. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and a range of motion exercises were initiated immediately after cast removal at 4 weeks, with partial progressive weightbearing allowed during the next 4 weeks.

An ankle malleolar fracture was fixed by the locking plate and cannulated cancellous screws with direct lateral and medial approach. He had finally consulted us because of worsening ankle pain while walking. On physical examination, there was tenderness in the anteromedial joint space of the right ankle. Slight ankle swelling was noted. Dorsiflexion of the right ankle was 10\u00b0, similar to that of the left ankle, but plantarflexion was restricted to 38\u00b0, compared with 60\u00b0 on the left, but the ankle instability test was negative.\nThe first three months, even though we performed intra-articular injections, arthroscopic synovectomy for osteoarthritis, and the fixation implant removal in order to release implant irritation, his ankle pain persisted.\nThe AOFAS ankle score at that point in time was 50 . Radiographs showed moderate narrowing of the ankle joint and forward displacement of the talus (-A, B). Computed tomography of the right ankle showed an osteochondral defect on the anterolateral surface of the distal tibial plafond (). This was diagnosed as progressive osteoarthritis caused by an osteochondral defect on the anterolateral surface of the distal tibial plafond, and surgical repair of the osteochondral defect was recommended. Three months later, the osteochondral graft was performed on the patient's right ankle. The patient was placed in the supine position under general anesthesia. The lower extremity was prepared and draped in the standard sterile fashion. We inserted the 2.0 mm K-wire in his right calcaneus, then skeletal traction was done in order to open his right ankle joint space if necessary. Next, 10 mL of fluid was injected intra-articularly to distend the ankle. The anterolateral ankle arthroscopy portal was established in the routine fashion, and global arthroscopy was performed. The osteochondral defect was identified about the anterolateral plafond which site was enthesis of the anterior tibiofibular ligament (), and osteochondral lesions of the tibia and talus were identified. An anteromedial portal was established. The osteochondral lesions were probed, and the osteochondral lesions were diagnosed as grade 2 according to the classification of the International Cartilage Repair Society . We performed multiple OAT in the anterolateral plafond at the anterolateral wall with extension of the anterolateral portal. The anterolateral osteochondral defect was measured 9 mm \u00d7 20 mm (). The plug donor site was the lateral corner of the patellar groove in the right knee joint. Under direct vision, we harvested 2 bone plugs from the normal bone deeper than the osteochondral defect for the preparation of the recipient site in order to accept the osteochondral plugs from the donor site in maximum plantarflexion. Then, the dilator was interpositioned into the recipient site, and a radiograph was taken to calculate the inclination angle between the dilator and tibial plafond. Therefore, we thought that the smooth surface was obtained by the inclination of the grafted plugs. According to the angle required, two 8-mm osteochondral autograft plugs ramped 35\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 were harvested from the donor site (), and transferred into the anterolateral plafond at an angle to re-contour the articular surface and make it smooth. Both harvest and transplantation of osteochondral autograft plugs were performed by open approaches for transplantation in the exact slope. After this procedure, the surface of the anterolateral wall of plafond was almost completely smooth (). The depth of these plugs was 20 mm, deeper than the osteochondral defect. It was confirmed that the deepest area of the plugs consisted of a macroscopically normal bone. We used press-fit technique in order to stabilize the osteochondral plugs. Stabilization of the osteochondral fragments relied on tight interference with the host bone. In case of difficulty with press-fit technique, a screw made of polylactic acid and hydroxyapatite was prepared, but it was never used.\nPostoperatively, the foot was placed in a short leg cast, and the patient was advised to ambulate non-weightbearing for a 4-week period. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and a range of motion exercises were initiated immediately after cast removal at 4 weeks, with partial progressive weightbearing allowed during the next 4 weeks.

An eye examination showed a lack of papilledema but was suspicious for mild peripheral loss of vision. Her past medical history was unremarkable. She did not have diencephalic syndrome at presentation. An urgent brain MRI demonstrated the presence of a large lobulated multicompartmental supra-sellar mass centered within the hypothalamus/optic chiasm (5.4cm x 3.4cm x 5cm) (Figure ), with extension into the surrounding structures and mass effect on the midbrain and third ventricle causing obstructive hydrocephalus. She initially underwent an endoscopic biopsy and septostomy, along with a right-sided ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt to manage her hydrocephalus. The pathology of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of a low-grade glioma (LGG) that was BRAF-V600E negative on immunohistochemistry but positive on next-generation sequencing (Figure ). She was started on chemotherapy with vincristine and carboplatin, but unfortunately she had rapid tumor progression with worsening hydrocephalus six weeks into chemotherapy. This progression caused the patient to develop further complications, including progressive right-sided hemiparesis, bitemporal hemianopia, central hypothyroidism, and feeding difficulties requiring a gastrostomy tube and placement of a second VP shunt. After extensive discussions and mutual expert consensus, her chemotherapy was stopped, and she was started on the novel targeted agent dabrafenib (5.25mg/kg/day).

He denied any associated symptoms. The patient had recently undergone multiple left knee revisions and received several antibiotics in an attempt to treat the draining chronic left knee infection (Table ).\nHe developed severe allergic reactions (urticarial rashes and angioedema) to cephalexin and ciprofloxacin trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Subsequently, 11 days prior to presentation, he was started on ertapenem and daptomycin. Moreover, before intravenous daptomycin and ertapenem were started, he had not received additional antibiotics for over a month. The patient had no previous history of pulmonary diseases and he denied any exposure to pulmonary irritants. Upon admission, the patient had a Hickman catheter for long-term antibiotic use without signs of acute inflammation. He had wheezing throughout the bilateral lung fields but no crackles. A draining tract with serosanguinous fluid drainage was observed on his left knee. His physical exam was otherwise unremarkable. The initial laboratory work demonstrated moderate anemia, normal white blood cells but with bandemia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (Table ).\nA chest x-ray showed new diffuse interstitial opacities (Figure ). A single anteroposterior portable chest X-ray was obtained on admission. Compared to a chest X-ray nine months prior, there were new diffuse branching interstitial opacities extending outward from hila associated with additional circular interstitial opacities. These were likely representing peribronchovascular interstitial thickening. There may be a trace of left pleural effusion without right pleural effusion. Additionally, the aorta was atherosclerotic and a right internal jugular central venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction was seen in situ.\nOn the second day of admission, the patient started having worsening shortness of breath, desaturation, tachycardia, and persistent fever. Examination of the lungs revealed bilateral crackles while the lower limbs and the trunk showed a new reticulopapular, non-pruritic rash. Repeat complete blood count (CBC) revealed new-onset eosinophilia. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed diffuse reticulonodular opacities in the lungs with peripheral predominance, areas of ground-glass opacities, and nodularities. Daptomycin AEP was suspected and the antibiotic was promptly discontinued and meropenem was started.

The surgery was performed under general anesthesia to facilitate the use of transesophageal echocardiography and to manage any intraoperative complications. She was taking 0.625 mg/day bisoprolol, a selective \u03b2-1 blocker, for hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation. Additionally, she was taking amlodipine for hypertension. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography showed severe AS (aortic valve peak flow velocity: 4.73 m/s; mean aortic valve pressure gradient: 47 mmHg; aortic valve area: 0.41 cm2) and myocardial hypertrophy (left ventricular posterior wall thickness and interventricular septum thickness: 14 mm).\nPre-anesthetic medication for sedation was not administered. She received bisoprolol and amlodipine 3 h before entering the operating room. Figure shows the anesthesia record. General anesthesia was induced using midazolam and remifentanil; additionally, rocuronium was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation. She received total intravenous anesthesia: continuous infusions of propofol and remifentanil. Noradrenaline and dopamine were infused continuously through the central venous catheter to maintain blood pressure. AS disappeared after valve implantation. During the surgery, complete atrioventricular block occurred, and ventricular pacing (VVI mode: 60 ppm) was initiated. No other complications were associated with the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, she received 100 mg sugammadex through the central venous catheter, but 2 min later, her systolic arterial blood pressure (ABP) decreased unexpectedly to less than 40 mmHg. Simultaneously, ventilator monitoring revealed elevated peak and plateau airway pressures (60 and 40 cmH2O, respectively). No skin rash was observed on the body surface. Transthoracic echocardiography showed underfilling of the left ventricle without right ventricular dilatation or pericardial effusion. No abnormalities were observed in left ventricular wall motion.\nThe patient developed distributive shock, which was clinically diagnosed as anaphylactic shock caused by sugammadex because of the rapid onset of severe hypotension and bronchospasm. First, two boluses of 0.05 mg adrenaline were administered through the central venous catheter, followed by rapid volume resuscitation using crystalloid (1 L infusion within 30 min). The dose of noradrenaline was increased to 0.3 \u03bcg/kg/min. Consequently, the airway pressures returned to the original level, but the hypotension persisted.

Her mother had end-stage breast cancer. We visited her house regularly to care for her mother. The woman with ASD was the main caregiver and a key person for her mother because her father was visually impaired. There were some obstacles we need to overcome together, but in the end, she was able to fulfill the role of the main caregiver for her mother.\nWhen we started home care for the mother, we did not have any knowledge that the daughter was a person with ASD. However, we occasionally heard about her from home visit nurses and home care staff because they worried about whether the mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members. According to home care staff members, the woman with ASD was usually not present when the home care staff visited the home for her mother's care. They could not contact her or talk with her about her mother's condition. She focused on dishwashing and did not appear concerned about how her mother's medications or clothes were organized or whether the room was clean or not. She could not communicate well with home care staff even when she talked with them. Thus, we did not initially recognize that she was a person with ASD or another developmental disorder. We were wondering why she was having trouble managing the home care schedule and chores even though she worked as an engineer. The home care staff's distrust of the daughter caused irritation and stress in the daughter and the home care staff.\nAfter a few home care visits, with the daughter's consent, the mother's care manager informed us that she had been diagnosed with ASD in adulthood. Her parents had not been informed of the diagnosis. The daughter did not want to let her parents know about the diagnosis. The home care staff started to feel strongly that it was too difficult for the daughter to continue home care for the mother. The woman with ASD also felt difficulties in communicating with staff and understanding how her mother felt or how it feels to be severely ill. Therefore, we initiated consultation and social skill training in our outpatient clinic for the daughter. We discussed the traits of ASD as well as solutions or strategies to manage ASD traits in the home care setting. When we gave her instructions, we tried to make them more specific and provided examples so that she could understand them easily. For example, we suggested that she needed to come into her mother's room to share her mother's condition when the home care staff made a visit.\nAfter several consultations, she gradually obtained life skills in communication, scheduling, and managing things related to home care, such as expectations during home care staff visits or what she should do for her mother. Her psychological stress and caregiving burden decreased day by day. We also shared the fact that she was diagnosed with ASD with home care staff as well as appropriate attitudes, support, and communication styles. We shared her behavioral characteristics with staff, such as lower interest in sharing emotions with others or having difficulties in understanding social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, and metaphors.\nFive months after the start of home-based care, her mother's condition worsened temporarily. The woman with ASD could not understand her mother's discomfort or pain and her father's sadness and serious feelings about the poor prognosis of his wife. She could not understand why her father was at a loss for words upon hearing the doctor's explanation of her mother's severe condition. Therefore, she asked him \u201cDidn't you hear, Dad?\u201d in a loud voice. These types of reactions by the daughter interfered with her father's acceptance of her mother's condition and he was unable to continue to listen the explanation. After this event, we explained why her father become silent while during the explanation of her mother's condition. We made a rule that we will tell her beforehand what we would say and how she should act when we share bad news. For example, we told her beforehand that we were going to tell her father about her mother's poor condition and prognosis and asked her to listen until we finished. We also told her how her father would react and our guess of the reasons for his reaction. Inappropriate behavior that is not suitable for the situation decreased afterward. She also felt relieved that she knew what she should do and could support her father as much as possible.\nSeven months after the start of home-based care, the mother passed away at home as her mother and she herself hoped. When her mother needed to use oral opioids and subcutaneous injection of opioids, the woman with ASD was able to communicate with homecare staff and ask for help to offer better care for her mother.

The patient first experienced paroxysmal involuntary left hand and toe flexion with left forearm pronation triggered by sudden voluntary movements at the age of 14. The frequency of attacks was 20\u201330 per day. Carbamazepine (100 mg/day) was prescribed, which led to a significant reduction in the frequency of attacks. However, drowsiness was significant after the intake of carbamazepine and significantly interfered with his daily life, especially school life. He underwent right-sided Vo thalamotomy at the age of 15, which resulted in complete resolution of PKD attacks immediately after the surgery. The detailed clinical course of right-sided Vo thalamotomy has been reported previously (). Four months after the thalamotomy, the patient developed right elbow, hand, and toe flexion (). The frequency of attacks was 10\u201320 per day. The duration of the attacks ranged from 10 to 20 seconds.

However, the drowsiness induced by carbamazepine severely interfered with his daily and school lives. He underwent left-sided Vo thalamotomy at the age of 19. The target coordinate of the left Vo nucleus was set the same as in the previous surgery (15-mm lateral, 2-mm posterior, and 1-mm superior to the midpoint of the anterior commissure-posterior commissure). A total of six lesions were created on the left Vo nucleus in the same manner as in the previous surgery. Immediately after surgery, the PKD attacks resolved completely. However, mild dysarthria developed, which spontaneously resolved within three months. Left-sided PKD attacks never developed six years after the right Vo thalamotomy, and right-sided PKD attacks never developed two years after the left Vo thalamotomy without medication. The locations of the coagulated lesions were confirmed using Brainlab Elements. Bilateral lesions covered the Vo and ventral intermediate (Vim) nuclei (). The Vo nucleus is located just anterior to the Vim nucleus of the thalamus. We included both anterior and posterior coagulated lesions in order to cover the entire Vo nucleus.

On August 2020, the patient underwent a wedge resection of the upper and the lower lung lobes lesions with N1 and N2 nodal sampling.\nGross examination of the surgical specimens of the first atypical pulmonary resection of left inferior lobe revealed an Intraparenchymal, peripheral, solid, yellow-white lesion measuring 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. Histological assessment identified a well-circumscribed lesion composed of two different morphological components, tightly adhered but not intermingled each other. The first component represented about 60% of the whole neoplasm and was characterized by a solid and trabecular proliferation of polygonal-shaped uniform tumor cells, with nuclei with finely granular chromatin and inconspicuocus nucleoli, consistent with carcinoid. Four mitosis/2 mm2 were identified, without tumoral necrosis. The second component, which represented about 40% of whole neoplasm, showed a main lepidic, non-mucinous pattern with secondary papillary architecture, corresponding to a lepidic-papillary pattern PA. Immunoreactivity for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, TTF-1, and pan-cytokeratins AE1\u20133 was documented in carcinoid component, while adenocarcinomatous component was positive only for TTF-1 and cytokeratins (). CK7 immunoreactivity was selectively documented in the adenocarcinomatous component. A final diagnosis of \u201ccombined pulmonary adenocarcinoma with atypical carcinoid\u201d was made.

Histologically, a well-circumscribed neoplasia composed of two different morphological components, which were separated in some areas and intermingled in others, was documented. The first component represented about 70% of the tumor burden and consisted of an organoid proliferation of polygonal, shaped uniform tumor cells with nuclei with finely granular chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli, consistent with carcinoid. Four mitosis/2 mm2 and diffuse, punctate necrosis were identified. The second component, representing about 30% of the tumor burden, showed a glandular architecture corresponding to acinar pattern of PA. Neoplastic infiltration of parietal pleura was documented (PL3). Immunoreactivity for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, TTF-1, and pan-cytokeratins (AE1-3 clone) was observed in carcinoid component, while glandular component was positive only for TTF-1 and cytokeratins; cytokeratin 7 was selectively expressed in the adenocarcinomatous component (). Metastatis constituted by both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine component was found in four out of six hilar lymph nodes, showing the same immunoreactivity in different neoplastic areas such as primitive lesion (). Immunoreactivity for ALK and ROS1 resulted negative in both component, in primitive tumor and in lymph nodal metastasis.

Extremity examination was notable for symmetric 2+ pitting edema to the midshin of both lower extremities. Skin exam revealed no purpura, Osler nodes, Janeway lesions, splinter hemorrhages, or track marks. Abdominal exam was nontender, and neurological examination was nonfocal.\nMultiple laboratory studies including 2 sets of blood cultures were obtained () and remarkable only for mild hyponatremia with a sodium of 127 mEq/L, a chloride of 90 mEq/L, and mild anemia with a hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL. There was no leukocytosis, troponin was undetectable, and brain-natriuretic peptide was within the normal range. These laboratory findings were not suggestive of any particular pathological processes. The finding of anemia was noted, but the lack of any corresponding elevation in bilirubin made acute hemolysis less likely. The hyponatremia was felt to be consistent with the patient's hypervolemic clinical picture. The lack of leukocytosis was noted, though limited inferences can be made from this value in isolation.

The CTA revealed findings consistent with multiple septic emboli and mycotic aneurysms (Figures and ), as well as multiple segmental pulmonary arterial occlusions with associated infarcts or hemorrhage. A stat formal echocardiogram was obtained and interpreted at bedside by the cardiology fellow, confirming the presence of tricuspid vegetations as well as moderate tricuspid regurgitation, with no evidence of right ventricular strain.\nThe patient was treated with IV vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin to provide coverage for possible MRSA endocarditis, due to the concern for possible undisclosed IVDU, and was admitted with consultation of Cardiothoracic Surgery and Infectious Disease (ID).\nThe patient was maintained on IV gentamycin and vancomycin and underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) on hospital day 2 which revealed a large 2.0 \u00d7 2.1 cm posterior leaflet tricuspid valve vegetation with severe tricuspid regurgitation. On hospital day 5, the patient admitted to a history of heroin IVDU but was not forthcoming about the date of her most recent use, and a urine toxicologic screen was negative.

You receive a referral from their primary care physician concerned about polycythemia. Their hemoglobin is 168 g/L with hematocrit 0.49, which has been flagged in the laboratory report as high (reported with female reference range of 115-155g/L and 0.33-0.45 relative to the male reference interval of 120-170g/L and 0.36-0.50).\nAndrogens are known to stimulate erythropoiesis while the impact of estrogens are not as well understood. In trans people who have been on established and full-dose feminizing hormone therapy (estradiol and anti-androgen) for at least 6 months, there is a significant decrease in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count to the female reference range (, ). Conversely after 6 months of masculinizing testosterone therapy, trans people demonstrate an increase in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count to the male reference range (, , , ). Serum hematocrit in the range of the affirmed gender is evident from 3 months after commencing gender-affirming hormone therapy (). Of note, there are association studies suggesting higher hematocrit is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (, ). This is probably a consideration for people using masculinizing hormone therapy, more so than those using feminizing hormone therapy. As smoking may additionally increase hematocrit, smoking cessation should be emphasized in those with elevated hematocrit. While the long-term cardiovascular implications of using a different reference range for hemoglobin or hematocrit are unclear in general, reference ranges of the affirmed gender should be used. Female reference ranges should be used for someone taking gender-affirming feminizing hormone therapy and male reference ranges should be used for people using masculinizing hormone therapy.\nIn trans women, there is a small statistically significant but clinically insignificant rise in platelet count (which remains within the normal reference range) shown in several cohort studies after 6 to 12 months of feminizing hormone treatment (, ), while white blood cells do not change significantly. No apparent changes are observed in either platelet count or white blood cells with masculinizing hormone therapy (, ).\nCase 1 outlines a nonbinary individual presumed female at birth receiving full-dose masculinizing hormone therapy. In this case, the male reference range for hemoglobin and hematocrit would be most appropriate and this should be shared with the nonbinary individual so they are aware and can expect to be misgendered when reviewing their own results.

Typically, people presumed male at birth have a higher eGFR than people presumed female at birth at the same level of serum creatinine because the formula assumes a higher muscle mass in men contributing to the serum creatinine independent of renal function. The difference between these groups (given the same age and weight) is more marked at higher levels (with a difference of approximately 30 when eGFR\u2005>90 mL/min/1.73m2), becoming much more similar as eGFR declines (difference of approximately 4 when eGFR\u2005<30 mL/min/1.73m2). In clinical situations where accurate assessment of renal function is necessary, such as in the transplant setting, it may be more appropriate to use 24-hour urine creatinine clearance, urinary inulin clearance (), or serum cystatin c levels, which are less affected by sex and not affected by muscle mass in contrast to serum creatinine (). Inulin clearance and cystatin c are more expensive and less readily available. Creatinine clearance can be calculated on paired 24-hour urine and serum creatinine concentration and is independent of muscle mass and sex steroids. This can provide a baseline estimation for renal function and cumulative serum creatinine results can then be used to monitor decline in renal function with aging.\nFrom a practical perspective, laboratory reports will need to make an assessment on how to report the eGFR for trans individuals. For individuals receiving masculinizing or feminizing hormone therapy, changes in body composition appear to be maximal in the early period after commencement, evident within the first 3 months of treatment (, ). For those receiving masculinizing hormone therapy with testosterone, given higher muscle mass and lower fat mass compared to females, the male CKD-EPI formula would be more appropriate.

Laboratory providers cannot report eGFR if a male or female marker is not provided on the request form, as this is required along with age to estimate eGFR. Using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula, if classified as female, the eGFR would be 45 mL/min/1.73m\nclassed as Stage 3 chronic kidney disease and would meet the guidelines for intravenous hydration prior to procedure. However, if classified male, the patient would have an eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73m\nwhich would be classed as Stage 2 chronic kidney disease and would not require prehydration. Which is the most appropriate eGFR to use?\nAccurately assessing renal function is essential for not only assessment of renal diseases, but also clinical situations that may potentially affect renal function (such as diabetes or radioiodine contrast administration) as well as considerations for medication dosing of renally cleared drugs. The most commonly used marker of renal function in clinical pathology laboratories is eGFR, which is calculated based upon an individual\u2019s serum creatinine level, age, and sex (). Typically, people presumed male at birth have a higher eGFR than people presumed female at birth at the same level of serum creatinine because the formula assumes a higher muscle mass in men contributing to the serum creatinine independent of renal function. The difference between these groups (given the same age and weight) is more marked at higher levels (with a difference of approximately 30 when eGFR\u2005>90 mL/min/1.73m2), becoming much more similar as eGFR declines (difference of approximately 4 when eGFR\u2005<30 mL/min/1.73m2). In clinical situations where accurate assessment of renal function is necessary, such as in the transplant setting, it may be more appropriate to use 24-hour urine creatinine clearance, urinary inulin clearance (), or serum cystatin c levels, which are less affected by sex and not affected by muscle mass in contrast to serum creatinine (). Inulin clearance and cystatin c are more expensive and less readily available. Creatinine clearance can be calculated on paired 24-hour urine and serum creatinine concentration and is independent of muscle mass and sex steroids. This can provide a baseline estimation for renal function and cumulative serum creatinine results can then be used to monitor decline in renal function with aging.\nFrom a practical perspective, laboratory reports will need to make an assessment on how to report the eGFR for trans individuals. For individuals receiving masculinizing or feminizing hormone therapy, changes in body composition appear to be maximal in the early period after commencement, evident within the first 3 months of treatment (, ). For those receiving masculinizing hormone therapy with testosterone, given higher muscle mass and lower fat mass compared to females, the male CKD-EPI formula would be more appropriate. Conversely if a person has been on feminizing hormone therapy, which typically induces gain in fat and decrease in muscle mass from 3 months of use, then the female equations should be used. It would be a challenging task to expect pathology laboratories to provide the \u201cright\u201d eGFR given limited access to clinical information.\nWe recommend that the treating clinician specify the sex-specific reference interval desired for reporting on the laboratory request (ie, female for a trans person using feminizing hormone therapy). Using current laboratory information systems, the gender marker can be used as a field to specify the reference range desired for reporting. While the binary female or male gender may not necessarily reflect the individual\u2019s gender, this will allow for the appropriate reference range to be reported and the trans patient informed so they can prepare to be misgendered. For laboratory providers, if the gender marker is unknown, then treating clinicians should be contacted to specify the sex-specific reference interval desired.\nFor the trans woman described in Case 2 who was on longstanding feminizing hormone therapy with female body composition, the female reference range for renal function would be most appropriate triggering appropriate renoprotection prior to administration of radioiodine contrast for her angiogram. From a harm reduction approach, given the absence of data in the field, if either the male or female calculated eGFR suggests renoprotective strategies, then this can be implemented.

Topicalization was achieved by spraying 2% lidocaine (7 ml) via the catheter onto the posterior nasal canal, pharyngeal cavity, epiglottis, glottis, and tracheal (Figure ). Meanwhile, supplemental oxygen 10 L/min was delivered by a hose (Figure ) through the mouth to avoid hypoxemia.

Thoracotomy performed on the right side showed a lesion in the lung parenchyma, extended to the upper and middle lobes. The differential diagnosis of congenital lesions of the lung was made. As there was no success with fine-needle aspiration in several cases, we decided to perform surgical resection.\nThe lesion was resected and lobectomy of both upper lobe and middle lobe was also performed. No associated lymphadenopathy was noted.\nMacroscopically, a well-circumscribed mass measuring 5.5 \u00d7 5.5 \u00d7 4 cm was present. The excised tumour had an osseous centre measuring 2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 cm. From the histological point of view, the mass consisted of disorganization of the normal bronchoalveolar parenchyma, myofibroblastic cells and inflammatory cell infiltrates, such as lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and histiocytes. In the centre of the lesion, a large ossification was found.\nImmunohistochemistry revealed calponin antigens, SMA, desmin, P53, bcL2, CK, HMW, and, in several myofibroblastic cells, expression of ALK-1. It was negative for beta-catenin, cyclin D1, Myo-D1, S100p, CD34, CD99 and CD117.\nThe histological and immunohistochemistry characteristics were compatible with an inflammatory myofibroblastic pseudotumor.\nThe post-operative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged home after 2 weeks of surgery.

An experienced forager, the patient had collected and prepared the mushrooms for dinner. Between six to eight hours later, the patient noted abdominal pain and associated vomiting. The vomitus was bilious in nature with multiple episodes occurring over the next two to three hours. With persistent vomiting, she called an ambulance that brought her to her local hospital. Admission and investigation found a deranged liver profile, and the diagnosis of acute liver failure secondary to the fungi consumption was made. Ms. XY was transferred to the National Liver Unit where she underwent orthotopic liver transplant. Following a tumultuous post-operative course including an ICU admission, and Hepatic, Renal, Plastics, Rheumatology and Dermatology input, an incidental finding on CT of the abdomen/pelvis foreshadowed the orthopaedic trajectory of our patient.\nFollowing discharge from the ICU, the patient began recovery on the ward. At this point, her primary concern was painful discolouration at the pulps of her fingers and toes. Painful lesions were also noted in the right flank region. Dermatology input resulted in a diagnosis of skin necrosis post-transplant with microvascular thrombosis of the hands and feet. Skin graft to the right flank region was performed by the Plastics team. The post-operative period was once again complicated by sepsis and treated with antibiotics. She remained on a prolonged course of steroids for up to six months post-operatively.\nAs XY continued to improve clinically, her recovery was aided by our multi-disciplinary team input. Throughout this period, the patient noted a new onset of groin pain resulting in regression in her mobility. In the proceeding four weeks, Ms. XY continued to suffer from pain, impeding her progress with physiotherapy. A physical exam now revealed a swollen and erythematous knee, with a reduced range of motion. An X-ray excluded knee pathology including joint effusion and fracture and confirmed normal alignment, as shown in Figure and Figure . The Pain team now became involved and recommended increased medication doses and frequency.\nXY\u2019s pain continued to increase over the subsequent six weeks and she was unable to engage fully in physiotherapy for six months. XY described the pain as sharp, without radiation and aggravated by movement. A physical exam revealed an oedematous swollen joint surrounding the cruciate ligament. An MRI was conducted as suggested by the pain team to investigate the integrity of the surrounding soft tissues. The cruciate ligaments, the menisci and both the quadriceips and patellar tendons were found to be intact. The associated musculature was atrophic. Several serpiginous lines within the subchondral marrow of the medial and lateral femoral condyles and in the patella with alternating hyper- and hypointensity were noted.

The decision to administer radiography, in this case, was based on the American College of Radiology guidelines, which cite an absence of in-utero deterministic effects of ionizing radiation effects after 27 weeks of gestation. Unfortunately, it was not possible to evaluate the symptoms of the patient with MRI at this time due to the coronavirus disease pandemic-induced stress on the healthcare system of our country.\nThe patient denied falls or trauma during the pregnancy, nor was there any history of smoking, alcohol abuse, use of glucocorticoids, or presence of rheumatologic/oncologic disease. Additionally, the patient was not malnourished, she underwent routine antenatal care, and took multivitamins. Serologic tests for inflammatory markers, as lab tests for serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and D-dimer returned normal.\nDuring multidisciplinary rounds, it was decided that delaying surgery was the best course of action out of fear of causing either mechanical or fluoroscopy-induced damage to the fetus during total hip arthroplasty. Five days later the patient experienced premature rupture of membranes, which was managed with emergency cesarean section (C-section) - no complications were encountered and a healthy 2300 g female was successfully delivered. Three days later the patient was transferred to our orthopedic surgery department for the treatment of the fracture. The significant degree of displacement (grade IV) of the fracture lasting over one week precluded open reduction with internal fixation due to fears of femoral head necrosis. During our literature review, we encountered a similar case of femoral neck fracture with grade IV displacement that was treated with open reduction internal fixation - despite restoration of blood flow to the femoral head within 15 hours, the authors still encountered femoral head necrosis with collapse six months later []. Given the considerable delay between symptom presentation and treatment, we decided the case warrants total hip arthroplasty instead of native hip salvage. Hemiarthroplasty was considered but was ultimately discarded as the conversion rate to total hip arthroplasty in young patients remain relatively high and the fracture was subsequently treated with a total uncemented prosthesis (Figure ), consisting of a 50 mm cup with 32 mm ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene insert and a 32 mm head with a 4 mm ceramic insert (Link Inc., Hamburg, Germany). Postoperative radiography confirmed prosthesis placement (Figure ); antibiotic and anticoagulant prophylaxis was initiated with ampicillin/sulbactam and enoxaparin sodium, respectively.\nThree days after the intervention the patient developed moderate abdominal pain without fever and accelerated intestinal transit, which both worsened over the next four days. Given the clinical presentation, there was a high index of suspicion for infection with Clostridium difficile (C. diff), although the diagnosis was ambiguous as the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the C. diff-specific antigen glutamate dehydrogenase was positive, while EIA for exotoxin A and B were negative. Due to exacerbation of symptoms and development of moderate hypokalemia (2.9 mEq/L), empiric treatment with metronidazole was began and marked rapid improvement.

Overall, the pathological findings are all suggestive features of a high-grade sarcoma, favouring the epithelioid variant of PLS.\nThe patient was also referred to the Department of Nuclear Medicine & Molecular Imaging for post-surgical restaging and assessment for possible metastases using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-FDG PET-CT) scan. The abdominopelvic section showed the liver measuring within normal limits; however, the scan revealed an ill-defined hypermetabolic hypodense lesion seen involving segment VI measuring approximately 2.8 x 1.8 cm suggestive of hepatic metastases with concurrent fatty liver. The scan was also remarkable for the musculoskeletal system, revealing multiple hypermetabolic osseous lesions involving the skull base, right iliac bone, and few vertebrae (predominantly T7-L1); which was suggestive of skeletal metastases. A non-hypermetabolic pulmonary nodule in the right lung field was also detected; it was considered to be likely benign, but interval scanning is suggested to monitor further progress. Finally, there was also evidence of diffuse subtle hypermetabolism at the site of surgery which is suggestive of postsurgical inflammatory sequelae; however, microscopic residual disease cannot be completely ruled out. These multi-organ lesions were due to be biopsied to examine their immunohistochemical findings to confirm metastatic lesions of primary pleiomorphic liposarcoma.

Because he started biting the metal locks on his abdominal belt, his hands and feet were also restrained.\nOn the second day, the patient was diagnosed with acute organic delirium caused by GHB withdrawal and treatment was initiated. In accordance with ICD-102, the diagnosis was based upon the clinical presentation in combination with a history of GHB substance abuse.

Clinically, the patient\u2019s state was compatible with acute intoxication, and the patient confirmed \u201cdrug intake,\u201d but quantification could not be specified at admission. Eight months prior, the patient had spent 2 weeks in deep propofol sedation at an intensive care unit (ICU) with acute organic delirium due to GHB withdrawal.\nAt the psychiatric ward, the patient\u2019s threatening and aggressive behavior intensified. To avoid violent incidents, the patient was subjected to physical restraint (abdominal belt) and tablet lorazepam 4 mg was administered twice. The patient was disorientated, started expressing paranoid ideas, and developed diaphoresis, tachycardia (heart rate 130 beats per min), and hyperthermia (37.8 \u00b0C, tympanic). Because he started biting the metal locks on his abdominal belt, his hands and feet were also restrained.\nOn the second day, the patient was diagnosed with acute organic delirium caused by GHB withdrawal and treatment was initiated. In accordance with ICD-102, the diagnosis was based upon the clinical presentation in combination with a history of GHB substance abuse. The patient was treated with a cumulative dose of 300 mg diazepam (40 mg as oral administration and 260 mg intravenously), without induction of sleep. To obtain sedation the restrained patient was transferred to the ICU, where he was intubated and sedated with intravenous infusions of propofol (up to 16 mg/kg/hour) and sufentanil (up to 100 \u03bcg/hour).\nOn days 3\u20136, the patient remained deeply sedated and on mechanical ventilation. To counteract potential withdrawal symptoms, clonidine 225 \u03bcg was administered every 6 hours via a nasogastric tube (NG tube), intravenous diazepam 20 mg every 5 hours, and continuous midazolam infusions (up to 1 mg/kg/hour). To prevent Wernicke encephalopathy, intravenous thiamine 200 mg and vitamin B 2 ml solution were given. Due to elevated C-reactive protein (64 mg/L) and white blood cell count (leukocytes 12.2 \u00d7 109/L; neutrophils 9.1 \u00d7 109/L), empiric treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam 4 g every 6 hours was initiated.\nOn day 6, a first wake-up call was attempted. However, upon awakening the patient was disoriented and severely agitated, and he was readily reintubated and resedated. The psychopharmacological treatment was intensified with olanzapine 20 mg/day (via NG-tube), intravenous diazepam 40 mg every 5 hours, clonidine 225 \u03bcg every 6 hours (via NG-tube), and continuous midazolam infusions (up to 1 mg/kg/hour).\nOn days 7\u20139, the intravenous diazepam was increased to 60 mg every 5 hours, and to supplement the propofol sedation, methadone 10 mg twice a day (via NG-tube) was initiated.\nOn day 10, a second wake-up was attempted. Again, the patient was disoriented, reported of ants crawling in the room, and presented with severe agitation. Physical restraints were reinstated and intravenous haloperidol 30 mg/day was added.\nOn day 11, the psychiatrists decided to initiate bilateral frontotemporal ECT as \u201cen bloc\u201d treatment, that is ECT on three consecutive days. Medication status during the three en bloc ECTs was: olanzapine 20 mg twice a day (BID, via NG-tube), methadone 10 mg BID (via NG-tube), intravenous phenobarbital 100 mg every 4 hours, pregabalin 150 mg BID (via NG-tube), haloperidol 5 mg as needed (PRN), up to 50 mg a day, clonidine 225 mg every 6 hours (via NG-tube), and continuous infusions of midazolam (up to 1 mg/kg/hour). Because treatment with high doses of benzodiazepines with long half-lives could compromise seizure induction, the starting ECT dose was set at the maximal energy of 200% (1008 mC) along with intravenous flumazenil 0.4 mg. The ECT series are shown in Fig. .\nOn day 12, the first ECT was administered (ECT #1A). Due to an administrative error, flumazenil was not administered, and restimulation with concurrent flumazenil was performed (ECT #1B). After ECT, the patient remained awake although clinically unchanged.\nOn day 13, the second ECT was administered (ECT #2). Subsequently, the patient\u2019s level of agitation decreased, he briefly responded adequately to verbal communication and sleep improved.\nOn day 14, the third ECT (ECT #3A) was administered. Due to seizure at threshold level, restimulation after hyperventilation was performed (ECT #3B). The patient was less agitated and engaged in brief conversations. Haloperidol was increased to 20 mg every 6 hours. On day 15, 50 mg hydroxyzine once a day (QD) was added.\nOn day 16, agitation had completely subsided, restraints were removed, and the patient cooperated with the remaining treatment.\nOn day 17, the fourth ECT was administered (ECT #4).

Two weeks prior to admission, she had symptoms of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea which was later diagnosed to be amebiasis. The patient was diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis at the age of 6 months when she developed arrhythmia related to a cardiac rhabdomyoma. The rest of the medical history included adenoma sebaceum, Ash leaf spots, bilateral renal angiomyolipomas, left-sided retinal hamartoma, and allergic rhinitis. She was previously operated 3 times for the removal of multiple renal angiomyolipomas and underwent partial cystectomy due to invasion of the tumor. Physical examination was normal. The laboratory work-up was unremarkable except for anemia (hemoglobin 9.6 g/dL) and an elevated C-reactive protein value of 125 mg/dL. The computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed extralumination of the rectal contrast material at the rectosigmoid region, indicating bowel perforation. The patient underwent proctosigmoidectomy and formation of an end colostomy together with the closure of the anorectal stump (Hartmann operation). Two weeks after the operation, the patient developed a new onset abdominal pain. The CT scan revealed contrast extralumination in the distal ileum and the patient underwent ileocecal resection due to a new onset bowel perforation and severe adhesions. Several days after the second operation she developed fever and was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection for which she took treatment. Both of the rectosigmoid resection specimen and the ileocecal resection specimen were reported as leiomyomatosis-like lymphangioleiomyomatosis (Fig. ). After 8 months of follow-up, the patient's rectoscopic examination together with a control CT scan was normal.

This is consistent with the aforementioned lesion in the left eye (Fig. B).\nUpon applying OCT to the vertical section through the fovea, the sclera curved posteriorly at the location superonasal to the fovea, and the choroid was thickened in the area (Fig. C). Additionally, the ellipsoid zone (EZ) was disrupted in the area between the fovea and the curved sclera. Horizontal volume scans of the OCT through the patchy lesion also showed posterior curvature of the sclera, thinning of the outer retina, and disappearance of the RPE\u2013Bruch's membrane complex, resulting in a pseudo-fovea appearance (Fig. D). Another horizontal volume scan of the OCT demonstrated a connection of blood vessels running from the sclera to the choroid (Fig. E). There was no obvious connection between the vitreous cavity and the superior choroidal cavity with OCT; taken together, we diagnosed this case as PCA with macular ICC.\nDuring a 4-year follow up, the white patchy lesion in the fundus and the hypofluorescence region determined by autofluorescence gradually expanded, especially toward the optic disc (Fig. A and B). The BCVA in the left eye decreased with the expansion of the lesion and was 20/100 at the final visit. OCT through the fovea showed that the disrupted EZ expanded toward the ICC and the sensory retina of the fovea became thinner with time (Fig. C). Moreover, RPE\u2013Bruch's membrane complex was not observed 3 years after the initial visit.

Histopathological findings of the biopsy specimen showed that the biphasic tumor cells consisted of large melanin-containing epithelioid cells and small neuroblast-like cells forming a solid alveolar pattern (Fig. A) and a gland-like pattern (Fig. B). The large tumor cells had a slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm and an oval bright nucleus with small but distinct nucleoli. These were occasionally positive for melanin pigment, which was visualized in the form of black granules on Fontana-Masson staining (Fig. C) and were bleached with potassium permanganate\u2013oxalic acid (Fig. D). The small tumor cells had a scanty cytoplasm and a slightly deeply stained round nucleus, often showing detached clusters. A small number of mitotic figures, and a low degree of cellular polymorphism were observed. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the large and small tumor cells were positive for neuron-specific enolase (Fig. A & B). The large tumor cells stained positive for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), human melanin black-45, and vimentin (Fig. C\u2013E). The small tumor cells stained positive for CD56 and synaptophysin (Fig. F & G). The tumor cells were negative for S-100 (Fig. H) and chromogranin A. The MIB-1 proliferation index was >50% (Fig. I). Based on these findings, the tumor was finally diagnosed as MNTI.\nThe tumor continued to grow rapidly, and marginal mandibulectomy was performed under general anesthesia 28 days after the first visit to our hospital. The extent of resection was determined by referring to the mandibular 3D model which was created based on the CT data obtained before the surgery. Marginal mandibulectomy, approximately 5 mm lateral to the tumor, was successful in preserving the inferior margin of the mandible (Fig. ). The mental foramen on the left side was included in the resection, and the foramen on the right side was preserved. All deciduous tooth germs were included in the excision, except for the right deciduous second molar. After rounding the sharp edges of the bone with a file, the raw surface of the mandible was completely closed by the surrounding soft tissue with help of polydioxanone monofilament synthetic absorbable suture. The postoperative course was uneventful, and oral intake of milk was started 3 days after the operation. On the 7th day after the surgery, the patient was discharged from the hospital with good general condition. At the time of discharge, he had no abnormal facial swelling or infection in the surgical wound.\nSimilar to biopsy specimens, histopathological findings of the excised mass showed that the tumor consisted of 2 types of cells: large polyhedral cells sometimes containing melanin granules and smaller round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scanty cytoplasm resembling lymphocytes. No nuclear atypia or mitosis was observed. Tumor cells were seen invading the surrounding tooth germs and bone.\nThe patient is being closely followed up, and no evidence of recurrence or metastasis was observed on CT images taken 1 year after surgery (Fig. ). In this case, stomatognathic functions such as eating, swallowing, and pronunciation were normal post-surgery, but occlusal reconstruction and recovery of masticatory function following removal of the mandibular dentition will be important therapeutic goals in the future.", "topic": "appropriate surgical management", "keypoint": "Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy (MNTI) management"}, {"clinical_note": "A 25-year-old man was diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy 12 years ago, which was treated with carbamazepine and zonisamide.

His clinical examination was largely unremarkable. We found melena on a digital\nrectal examination. An upper GI endoscopy revealed a large mass projecting into the gastric\nlumen ( ), arising from the posterior gastric\nwall. The lesion was closer to the lesser gastric curvature than the greater curvature. At\nthe summit, the mass suffered from a bleeding mucosal ulcer, the cause of his melena.\nSeveral endoscopic biopsies were inconclusive, consisting of only gastric mucosal tissue\nwithin the biopsy specimens. An endoscopic ultrasound-guided needle aspiration revealed\nstromal cells on cytology. An abdominal CT demonstrated a well-defined, intramural mass\narising close to the lesser gastric curvature with a small mucosal defect at the\nsuperolateral aspect of the lesion ( ). The\nsoft-tissue fat planes were intact and there were no enlarged or abnormally enhancing lymph\nnodes. The patient's severe anemia was corrected with several preoperative transfusions.\nOperative steps : Under general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with\nhis legs split. Laparoscopic ports were inserted as shown in . The initial diagnostic laparoscopy did not reveal any peritoneal\ninvolvement. The lesser sac was accessed by dividing the gastrocolic and posterior gastric\nattachments. The tumor mass was large, making gastric retraction difficult. The tumor base\nat the posterior gastric wall exhibited increased vascularity ( ) without any evidence of invasion into adjacent tissues. After replacing\nthe stomach in its natural position, a liberal, longitudinal anterior gastrotomy was created\nat the summit of the tumor using ultrasonic shears. Manipulation of the tumor mass had\ncaused brisk bleeding from the ulcer, which could not be controlled with bipolar energy. The\ntumor was delivered through the gastrotomy ( ) and\npivoted over the shaft of a grasper placed parallel to the splenic axis. This caused the\ngastric wall adjacent to the tumor base to tent ( \n), allowing us to apply several linear staplers across it ( ). All sequential stapler fires were applied in close apposition to the tumor,\nwith the intention to save as much of the uninvolved posterior gastric wall. The use of\nstaplers not only allowed us to resect the lesion, which halted bleeding, but also\nsimultaneously reconstructed the posterior gastric wall. The staple line was oversewn on its\nluminal aspect with 2\u20130 polydiaxonone suture in a continuous manner after the resected\nlesion was placed in an endobag and parked adjacent to the right hepatic lobe. The anterior\ngastrotomy was closed using 2\u20130 delayed-absorbable barbed suture in two layers. The patient\nwas placed in a steep Trendelenburg position, and saline was instilled into the upper\nabdomen. Intraoperative gastroscopy with intraluminal CO2 insufflation helped objectively\nconfirm the integrity of the gastrotomy closures. The saline was suctioned out and a drain\nwas placed adjacent to the stomach through the flank port. The specimen was retrieved\nthrough a Pfannenstiel incision. The resected specimen measured 9.5 \u00d7 8.5 \u00d7 7.5 cm ( ). The operative time was 195 minutes, and the\nestimated blood loss was 175 mL (see video, supplemental digital content 1, which\ndemonstrates the clinical course of the patient and operative steps).\nThe patient commenced oral fluids on the second postoperative day and a blenderized soft\ndiet on day 4. His abdominal drain was pulled on day 4, and he was discharged from the\nhospital on day 5.

She had a history of left-side breast cancer and underwent total left mastectomy at the age of 67, with no recurrence thereafter. Although she was a carrier of hepatitis C, her liver function and coagulation remained normal, and she was being followed-up without medication. Furthermore, she was taking nifedipine and candesartan cilexetil for hypertension. Meanwhile, her family history and psychosocial history were unremarkable. She also had no history of trauma.\nCT showed a 7.5-cm long elliptical mass in the left adnexal region that was continuous with the uterus (Fig. ). The ovary was atrophic because of the patient\u2019s age, and difficult to identify; the appearance of blood and the continuity with the surrounding pelvic peritoneum were suggestive of retroperitoneal hematoma. Physical findings at admission were as follows: height, 144.5 cm; weight, 57.2 kg; body mass index (BMI), 27.4 kg/m2; blood pressure, 112/50 mm Hg; pulse, 72 bpm; and body temperature, 37.1 \u00b0C. Physical examination detected no significant findings. On external (body surface) and internal examinations, no palpable masses or tenderness were noted in the left pelvic area. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed an atrophied uterus; however, the bilateral adnexa could not be identified due to atrophy. The hematoma in the left pelvis could be identified. These findings were identical to those obtained by CT. Blood test results were a hemoglobin value of 9.5 g/dL, a hematocrit value of 28.4%, a white blood cell count of 7970/\u03bcL, and a C-reactive protein level of 0.05 mg/dL. Urinalysis revealed mild occult blood. After admission, the hematoma did not enlarge, and the hemoglobin and hematocrit levels did not decrease. After 11 days of bed rest, with no exacerbation of the inflammatory response, lower abdominal pain was relieved, and she was discharged. After discharge, we planned to investigate the cause of her bleeding on an outpatient basis, but 6 days after discharge, she was readmitted to our hospital after relapse of symptoms caused by retroperitoneal bleeding from the same site. The hematoma had grown to a size of 11.7 cm, and magnetic resonance imaging showed an abnormal vascular network extending from the left side of the uterus to the left adnexal area. Three-dimensional CT (3D-CT) similarly showed an abnormal vascular network on the left side of the uterus, and we suspected a possible arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or arteriovenous fistula (AVF) from the uterine artery to the left ovarian vein (LOV; Fig. ).\nWe decided that urgent treatment was needed for her repeated bleeding and performed vascular embolization therapy simultaneously with angiography. However, angiography of the internal iliac artery, including the left uterine artery, and the left external iliac artery, did not show AVM or AVF into the LOV. Angiography of the left renal artery confirmed that the contrast medium discharged from the left kidney did not flow into the inferior vena cava (IVC) but flowed back into the LOV (Fig. a). Subsequent venography also confirmed that the blood from the LRV did not flow into the IVC but regurgitated into the LOV and the lumbar vein (Fig. b). Left ovarian venography showed retrograde blood flow into a dilated and tortuous aneurysm in the pelvis and into the right internal iliac vein via a vein around the uterus (Fig. c). The cause of retroperitoneal bleeding was rupture of the LOV, the distension of which was caused by reflux. We performed embolization of LOV with N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate and placed a coil centrally to prevent recanalization. Postembolization LRV imaging showed blood flow to the upper left lumbar vein and vertebral plexus (Fig. d). CT on the second day after the procedure confirmed good embolization of LOV and reduction of the retroperitoneal hematoma to a size of 6.4 cm (Fig. ). The patient then underwent regular outpatient follow-up, and the retroperitoneal hematoma gradually shrank and disappeared. At her final visit 2 years later, the hematoma had not recurred.\nIn this case, angiography confirmed the continuity of LRV and IVC but demonstrated no antegrade blood flow to the IVC. Therefore, we attributed LOV regurgitation to extravascular physical compression of LRV. After close examination of the CT images, we determined that LOV rupture was caused by NCS because the LRV was severely stenotic between the abdominal aorta and the SMA (Fig. ).", "topic": "the cause/infectious agent or predisposing factor(s)", "keypoint": "Ovarian torsion"}, {"clinical_note": "A 77-year-old Japanese woman, para 7, who went through menopause at age 48, suffered sudden onset of left lower abdominal pain and visited a primary care doctor.

Physical examination detected no significant findings. On external (body surface) and internal examinations, no palpable masses or tenderness were noted in the left pelvic area. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed an atrophied uterus; however, the bilateral adnexa could not be identified due to atrophy. The hematoma in the left pelvis could be identified. These findings were identical to those obtained by CT. Blood test results were a hemoglobin value of 9.5 g/dL, a hematocrit value of 28.4%, a white blood cell count of 7970/\u03bcL, and a C-reactive protein level of 0.05 mg/dL.

After 11 days of bed rest, with no exacerbation of the inflammatory response, lower abdominal pain was relieved, and she was discharged. After discharge, we planned to investigate the cause of her bleeding on an outpatient basis, but 6 days after discharge, she was readmitted to our hospital after relapse of symptoms caused by retroperitoneal bleeding from the same site. The hematoma had grown to a size of 11.7 cm, and magnetic resonance imaging showed an abnormal vascular network extending from the left side of the uterus to the left adnexal area. Three-dimensional CT (3D-CT) similarly showed an abnormal vascular network on the left side of the uterus, and we suspected a possible arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or arteriovenous fistula (AVF) from the uterine artery to the left ovarian vein (LOV; Fig. ).\nWe decided that urgent treatment was needed for her repeated bleeding and performed vascular embolization therapy simultaneously with angiography. However, angiography of the internal iliac artery, including the left uterine artery, and the left external iliac artery, did not show AVM or AVF into the LOV.

Subsequent venography also confirmed that the blood from the LRV did not flow into the IVC but regurgitated into the LOV and the lumbar vein (Fig. b). Left ovarian venography showed retrograde blood flow into a dilated and tortuous aneurysm in the pelvis and into the right internal iliac vein via a vein around the uterus (Fig. c). The cause of retroperitoneal bleeding was rupture of the LOV, the distension of which was caused by reflux. We performed embolization of LOV with N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate and placed a coil centrally to prevent recanalization.

He had post-exercise exhaustion and shortness of breath for almost 2 years, and experienced a sudden dizziness with visual rotation and syncope. Despite the medical therapy, the clinical symptoms gradually worsened. Echocardiogram showed a dilated and poorly functioning right ventricle, as well as a small left heart with normal systolic and diastolic function (Fig. -A1, A2)(Tricuspid annular plane systolic excusion (TAPSE) 9.6 mm, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 64%, average E/E\u203211.94, lateral E\u203212.1 cm/s,tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity 2.5 m/s). Ventilation/perfusion scan and computed tomography angiogram confirmed the presence of CTEPH at the sub-segmental levels.\nAfter the patient was induced, the initial pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) was 93/46(63) mmHg, and preoperative right radial artery blood pressure (ABP) was 120/88 mmHg. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring presented the basic cerebral regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) range from 60 to 65%. After median sternotomy, the ascending aorta and both vena cava were cannulated regularly, and CPB was initiated. After the initiation of CPB, the mean PAP (mPAP) decreased to the range from17 to 31 mmHg. Aortic cross-clamping and blood cardioplegia were administered during pulmonary arteries dissociation. Then, the removal of thickened arterial intima and old organized thrombi was completed under deep hypothermic (22 \u00b0C) low flow (DHLF) and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). NIRS fluctuates from 55 to 60% during DHLF and DHCA. After the surgical procedures, full flow was restored, heart rebeated, and the patient was gradually rewarmed to normal. Norepinephrine (0.05\u03bcg/kg.min), epinephrine (0.02\u03bcg/kg.min), and isoproterenol (0.02\u03bcg/kg.min) were used to maintain stable hemodynamics. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed good systolic and diastolic heart function.\nHowever, during the first attempt to discontinue CPB, the PAP increased rapidly to 63/35(43) mmHg, with unstable hemodynamic (ABP 70/40 mmHg), and TEE suggested right heart insufficiency, accompanied with normal left ventricular function. Then, CPB was resumed immediately. After assisting for another 45 min and increasing the dosage of vasoactive drugs (norepinephrine 0.06\u03bcg/kg.min, epinephrine 0.05\u03bcg/kg.min, isoproterenol 0.05\u03bcg/kg.min), the separation failed again, just the same as the first time. Considering that severe residual PH combined with right heart dysfunction are the main reasons for the failure of CPB weaning, ECMO was adopted. Consequently, 19F arterial cannula and 22F venous cannula were inserted into the right femoral vessels, and femoral VA-ECMO was initiated with a flow of 3.0 ~ 3.5 L/min. On arrival at the intensive care unit, ECMO flow rate was 3.5 L/min, and severe PH (PAP 56/25 mmHg) persisted with low ABP (70/55 mmHg). Echocardiography revealed significant decrease of biventricular function (Fig. B)(TAPES4mm, LVEF28%, average E/E\u203215, lateral E\u20326.7 cm/s, TR velocity 4.1 m/s) on postoperative day (POD) 1, indicating the patient developed severe secondary left ventricular dysfunction on the basis of right ventricular dysfunction, during ECMO support. The postoperative troponin-T(C-TNT) increased gradually (Fig. ), which suggested the myocardial injuries occurred. Hence, comprehensive measures were adapted: ECMO flow rate was reduced from 3.5 L/min to 2.5 L/min to decrease left ventricular afterload while maintaining systemic perfusion, norepinephrine (0.1\u03bcg/kg.min), epinephrine (0.06\u03bcg/kg.min) and isoproterenol (0.06\u03bcg/kg.min) were increased to ensure coronary perfusion, inhaled nitric oxide and treprostinil were administered to relieve PH. Besides, tidal volume was reduced to 6 ml/kg, and PEEP (5 cmH2O) was initiated to achieve lung protective ventilation. Oxygen flow rate was increased from 2 L/min to 6 L/min, with oxygen concentration raised to 47% for myocardial oxygen supply improvement. Moreover, atrial septostomy was carried out to decompress the right ventricle, so as to reduce the PAP. Consequently, mPAP decreased to 10 mmHg gradually, and the cardiac function improved slowly.\nOn POD 7, echocardiography revealed a normal sized heart with acceptable ventricular function (Fig. C). In this condition, ECMO was discontinued successfully, with satisfactory BP (90 ~ 120/50 ~ 80 mmHg), and normal PAP (mPAP 10-12 mmHg).

Oxygen flow rate was increased from 2 L/min to 6 L/min, with oxygen concentration raised to 47% for myocardial oxygen supply improvement. Moreover, atrial septostomy was carried out to decompress the right ventricle, so as to reduce the PAP.

NIRS fluctuates from 55 to 60% during DHLF and DHCA. After the surgical procedures, full flow was restored, heart rebeated, and the patient was gradually rewarmed to normal. Norepinephrine (0.05\u03bcg/kg.min), epinephrine (0.02\u03bcg/kg.min), and isoproterenol (0.02\u03bcg/kg.min) were used to maintain stable hemodynamics. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed good systolic and diastolic heart function.\nHowever, during the first attempt to discontinue CPB, the PAP increased rapidly to 63/35(43) mmHg, with unstable hemodynamic (ABP 70/40 mmHg), and TEE suggested right heart insufficiency, accompanied with normal left ventricular function. Then, CPB was resumed immediately. After assisting for another 45 min and increasing the dosage of vasoactive drugs (norepinephrine 0.06\u03bcg/kg.min, epinephrine 0.05\u03bcg/kg.min, isoproterenol 0.05\u03bcg/kg.min), the separation failed again, just the same as the first time. Considering that severe residual PH combined with right heart dysfunction are the main reasons for the failure of CPB weaning, ECMO was adopted. Consequently, 19F arterial cannula and 22F venous cannula were inserted into the right femoral vessels, and femoral VA-ECMO was initiated with a flow of 3.0 ~ 3.5 L/min. On arrival at the intensive care unit, ECMO flow rate was 3.5 L/min, and severe PH (PAP 56/25 mmHg) persisted with low ABP (70/55 mmHg). Echocardiography revealed significant decrease of biventricular function (Fig. B)(TAPES4mm, LVEF28%, average E/E\u203215, lateral E\u20326.7 cm/s, TR velocity 4.1 m/s) on postoperative day (POD) 1, indicating the patient developed severe secondary left ventricular dysfunction on the basis of right ventricular dysfunction, during ECMO support. The postoperative troponin-T(C-TNT) increased gradually (Fig. ), which suggested the myocardial injuries occurred. Hence, comprehensive measures were adapted: ECMO flow rate was reduced from 3.5 L/min to 2.5 L/min to decrease left ventricular afterload while maintaining systemic perfusion, norepinephrine (0.1\u03bcg/kg.min), epinephrine (0.06\u03bcg/kg.min) and isoproterenol (0.06\u03bcg/kg.min) were increased to ensure coronary perfusion, inhaled nitric oxide and treprostinil were administered to relieve PH. Besides, tidal volume was reduced to 6 ml/kg, and PEEP (5 cmH2O) was initiated to achieve lung protective ventilation. Oxygen flow rate was increased from 2 L/min to 6 L/min, with oxygen concentration raised to 47% for myocardial oxygen supply improvement. Moreover, atrial septostomy was carried out to decompress the right ventricle, so as to reduce the PAP. Consequently, mPAP decreased to 10 mmHg gradually, and the cardiac function improved slowly.\nOn POD 7, echocardiography revealed a normal sized heart with acceptable ventricular function (Fig. C). In this condition, ECMO was discontinued successfully, with satisfactory BP (90 ~ 120/50 ~ 80 mmHg), and normal PAP (mPAP 10-12 mmHg).
