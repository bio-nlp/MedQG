0,"A 63-year-old male presented on November 16, 2018, with complaints of persistent left epistaxis and a history of swelling in the left orbit and maxillary sinus for 3 months. Examination revealed multiple enlarged, indurated, and painless lymph nodes in the cervical and left submandibular areas, the largest of which was 4 mm × 3 mm. Blood tests at diagnosis showed anemia (Hb 122 g/L) and thrombocytopenia (90 × 109/L). Syphilis and HIV screenings were negative. Initial enhancement MRI scanning on November 27, 2018, revealed heterogeneous enhancement shadow filling in the left maxillary sinus along with adjacent bone absorption ().
The patient underwent a subsequent biopsy by nasal endoscopy on November 29, 2018. Histology highlighted a diffuse infiltrate of large atypical cells with lymphocytic or plasmacytoid morphology (). Neoplastic cells expressed a high proliferative index (Ki-67, 95%) (). Immunohistochemical profiling showed positive results in neoplastic cells for MUM1, CD38, CD138, c-myc, and EBV-EBER, the ratio of kappa chain (+) neoplastic cells to lambda chain (+) neoplastic cells is greater than 64:1 (), and they were negative for CD30, CD19, CD79a, PAX-5, CD20, CD21, bcl-6, CD10, bcl-2, CD15, HMB45, S-100, MelanA, CK, and EMA ().18F-FDG PET/CT was performed for further assessment of the mass lesion metabolic activity and the general conditions at diagnosis on December 6, 2018. Transverse PET/CT scan revealed a 3.7 cm × 3.9 cm × 4.3 cm solid mass, partial bone destruction, and swelling of soft tissues. A markedly FDG-avid space-occupying lesion was observed at the left maxillary sinus, and it invaded the left nasal cavity, left orbital apex, and left alar mandibular space (SUVmax, 7.8; SUVmean, 6.3) (). Bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy were negative for lymphoma involvement. The screening investigations specific for multiple myeloma or plasmacytoma results showed that this patient was negative for serum protein electrophoresis, immunofixation, and free light chain assay. The final diagnosis was confirmed to be consistent with stage II PBL.
With curative intent, bortezomib was initiated (2.3 mg d1, 4, 8, 11) in combination with CDOP (cyclophosphamide 1.3 g d2, epirubicin 40 mg d2, vindesine 4 mg d21, prednisolone 65 mg d2–6) chemotherapy regimen on a 21-day cycle. After two cycles of V-CDOP, enhanced MRI scanning on February 11, 2019, revealed an excellent initial response, with a substantial decrease in the size and intensity of nasopharyngeal lesions (). After three cycles of the V-CDOP regimen, re-evaluation of the 18F-FDG PET/CT in the transverse dimension on May 21, 2019, showed a diminished range of lesions to 3.8 cm × 2.9 cm × 3.8 cm and reduced 18F-FDG uptake in the left maxillary sinus (SUVmax, 7.0; SUVmean, 4.5) and other regions (SUVmax, 4.0; SUVmean, 3.6) (). The patient achieved a partial response (PR) after five cycles of V-CDOP chemotherapy treatment.
This planned treatment was followed by mobilization and collection of autologous peripheral blood stem cells on May 24, 2019. After one cycle of V-CDOP, enhanced MRI scanning revealed no significant change on June 27, 2019 (). On regular follow-up, he received local radiotherapy (RT) to nasopharyngeal regions (30 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks). After RT, he was switched to two cycles of V-CDOP regimens supplemented with lenalidomide (25 mg d1–21) on August 9 and September 10, 2019. The main toxic side effect was grade 2 myelosuppression and improved after symptomatic treatment. Subsequent enhancement MRI scanning revealed a reduction in the size of nasopharyngeal lesions on September 14, 2019 (). The therapeutic assessment by FDG PET/CT on September 29, 2019, showed a complete metabolic response (cMR), a diminished range of lesions to 1.0 cm × 1.3 cm, significantly reduced 18F-FDG uptake in the left maxillary sinus (SUVmax, 3.5; SUVmean, 2.5), and a lack of metabolic activity in other regions ().
The patient received conditioning BEAM (BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) high-dose chemotherapy with consolidative autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in October 25, 2019. A total of 8.6 × 108/kg mononuclear cells (MNCs) and 2.1 × 106/kg CD34+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBSCs) were reinfused, and complete engraftment was observed by day + 11. During autologous transplantation, he experienced grade 4 myelosuppression, requiring G-CSF. To consolidate the response, the patient received lenalidomide-based maintenance therapy after the transplant. A repeated enhancement MRI scanning showed increased abnormal signal shadows in the maxillary sinus, which was considered as an inflammatory reaction on May 6, 2020 (). He developed herpes zoster during maintenance treatment on October 2020. Follow-up PET-CT on March 10, 2021 showed continued cMR 16 months after ASCT (). Currently, the patient was monitored with serial MRI scanning and presented 32 months OS and 22 months PFS.",cyclophosphamide,"mechanisms, drugs","A 63-year-old male patient was diagnosed with stage II Plasmablastic Lymphoma after presenting with persistent left epistaxis and swelling in the left orbit and maxillary sinus.

1,"This was a 43-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma who had undergone liver transplantation from a living donor. A year later, he developed severe acute pancreatitis with severe abdominal pain. On admission to the hospital, continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl at 1200 μg/day was started to control abdominal pain. The fentanyl dose was increased according to pain intensity, reaching 2400 μg/day (MED 240 mg/day) after 10 days in the hospital. Administration of a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotic, and fluid alleviated the pancreatitis and abdominal pain. shows that continuous fentanyl infusion was discontinued after reaching 240 μg/day (10% of the maximum dose). He subsequently developed nausea/vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation. Continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion of 240 μg/day was resumed, and these symptoms disappeared. However, restlessness occurred each time the dose was reduced. Therefore, a transdermal fentanyl patch was initiated to taper the opioid more slowly. Pancreatitis with abdominal pain recurred transiently one month later. Therefore, continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion was resumed, titrated to 600 μg/day. The dose was gradually decreased daily (600, 300, 240, 180, 120, and 60 μg/day). Once the pancreatitis had improved, the fentanyl could be discontinued without causing withdrawal symptoms. The discontinuation was finally completed 64 days after the onset of withdrawal symptoms.",opioid withdrawal,knows signs/symptoms of selected disorders,"A 43-year-old male with a history of liver transplantation developed severe acute pancreatitis, for which he was administered a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl.

2,"A 70-year-old man was referred to our institution by his family doctor for the examination of repeated upper abdominal pain. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) suggested resectable pancreatic cancer of the pancreatic body (Fig. A) concomitant with stricture of the CA root (Fig. B), which may have been caused by median arcuate ligament (MAL). Pancreaticoduodenectomy with division of the MAL was scheduled. Unexpected bleeding around the CA was observed during surgery, which may have been caused by the injury incurred when the MAL was cut to release CA compression (Fig. A, B). As bleeding could be controlled by simple compression only, hemostasis by suturing was attempted first. Contrary to our expectations, the bleeding intensified, making it difficult to confirm the bleeding point. Therefore, we attempted supraceliac aortic cross-clamping (SAC) to manage bleeding. To expose the aorta, the crus of the diaphragm was divided, and the aorta was clamped upstream of the CA by a Fogarty vascular-clamp forceps. After performing SAC, the bleeding intensity significantly decreased and a defect of the adventitia measuring 7 mm in diameter on the CA was confirmed (Fig. C). The defect was repaired using a 4-0 Prolene continuous suture (Johnson & Johnson K.K, NJ, USA). The procedure time for SAC was 2 min and 51 s, and the intraoperative blood loss was 480 ml. The maximum blood pressure increased from 120 to 150 mmHg when SAC was performed and then decrease to 120 mmHg after releasing the clamp. The operative policy was changed to underdo distal pancreatectomy to decrease the risk of hepatic infarction. The patient was discharged uneventfully on postoperative day 19.

Additionally, a stricture at the root of the celiac artery (CA) was observed, possibly due to the median arcuate ligament (MAL). During the planned pancreaticoduodenectomy with division of the MAL, unexpected bleeding occurred near the CA. This was managed by performing a supraceliac aortic cross-clamping (SAC).

3,"A 75-year-old male presented to our hospital with worsening mental status. Gait instability and expressive aphasia were noted on the physical examination. He was otherwise hemodynamically stable, with unremarkable laboratory studies and a negative urine drug screen. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast showed a large right frontoparietal lesion crossing midline with surrounding vasogenic edema (Figure ). Further characterization with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 5.5-cm intra-axial mass within the deep white matter of the right frontal lobe, with gadolinium enhancement and prominent FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) signal concerning malignancy.
Later, the patient was started on dexamethasone, and a frontal stereotactic brain biopsy was performed. The initial pathology report showed a B-cell lymphoma with cells positive for CD20 immunostain (Figures -). However, due to its complexity, the sample was sent to an outside institution for a second opinion, which found the sample to be positive for the MYD88L265P mutation. Due to the strong association between this mutation and WM, quantitative serum immunoglobulins were measured, which showed an elevated IgM monoclonal paraprotein, confirming the diagnosis of WM.
The patient was started on treatment with rituximab, methylprednisolone, carfilzomib, and ibrutinib. The patient showed a good response by MRI at three months, and he was transitioned to oral ibrutinib only. Surveillance MRI at one year post-diagnosis showed patchy right frontal lobe enhancement indicating disease progression, although the patient had no clinical symptoms; he was then restarted on the initial chemo-immunotherapy protocol. However, ibrutinib was later held due to thrombocytopenia. Soon after, the patient presented to the hospital again with cognitive dysfunction, leg weakness, and falls, with MRI showing significant disease progression. At this point, his treatment was changed to palliative chemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate and rituximab. His disease responded avidly to this regimen, and he is currently completing a one-year course of treatment, with no radiologic or clinical evidence of recurrence (Figure ).",about rituximab,Knows adverse effects of various drugs or recognizes signs and symptoms of drug (and drug-drug) interactions,"A 75-year-old male patient was diagnosed with a B-cell lymphoma variant, specifically Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM).

4,"A 79-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic infection of a left knee prosthesis, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease stage 3A presented to the wound care clinic after two days of subjective fever that partially improved with acetaminophen. He denied any associated symptoms. The patient had recently undergone multiple left knee revisions and received several antibiotics in an attempt to treat the draining chronic left knee infection (Table ).
He developed severe allergic reactions (urticarial rashes and angioedema) to cephalexin and ciprofloxacin trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Subsequently, 11 days prior to presentation, he was started on ertapenem and daptomycin. Moreover, before intravenous daptomycin and ertapenem were started, he had not received additional antibiotics for over a month. The patient had no previous history of pulmonary diseases and he denied any exposure to pulmonary irritants. Upon admission, the patient had a Hickman catheter for long-term antibiotic use without signs of acute inflammation. He had wheezing throughout the bilateral lung fields but no crackles. A draining tract with serosanguinous fluid drainage was observed on his left knee. His physical exam was otherwise unremarkable. The initial laboratory work demonstrated moderate anemia, normal white blood cells but with bandemia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (Table ).
A chest x-ray showed new diffuse interstitial opacities (Figure ). A single anteroposterior portable chest X-ray was obtained on admission. Compared to a chest X-ray nine months prior, there were new diffuse branching interstitial opacities extending outward from hila associated with additional circular interstitial opacities. These were likely representing peribronchovascular interstitial thickening. There may be a trace of left pleural effusion without right pleural effusion. Additionally, the aorta was atherosclerotic and a right internal jugular central venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction was seen in situ.
On the second day of admission, the patient started having worsening shortness of breath, desaturation, tachycardia, and persistent fever. Examination of the lungs revealed bilateral crackles while the lower limbs and the trunk showed a new reticulopapular, non-pruritic rash. Repeat complete blood count (CBC) revealed new-onset eosinophilia. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed diffuse reticulonodular opacities in the lungs with peripheral predominance, areas of ground-glass opacities, and nodularities. Daptomycin AEP was suspected and the antibiotic was promptly discontinued and meropenem was started. Methylprednisolone and inhaled breathing treatments were ordered and the patient’s symptoms significantly improved thereafter. A repeat chest x-ray one month later showed resolution of the interstitial markings (Figure ). One month after the initial presentation, a repeat chest x-ray was obtained. The lungs appeared clear without apparent pleural effusion. No active disease in the chest was identified.",daptomycin withdrawal,immediate management or priority in management,"A 79-year-old male with a history of chronic knee infection and allergies to multiple antibiotics was recently started on ertapenem and daptomycin.

5,"A 35-year-old man presented with the complaints of low back ache for 12 years, radiating to right leg for 4 months and numbness extending to lateral side of the sole of right foot. On examination, there was a 30% sensory loss in right S1 dermatome as compared with contralateral limb, with no bladder bowel involvement. Patient had no motor deficit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral spine was suggestive of IM cystic lesion at L2-3 hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. MRI brain did not reveal any abnormality. Lumbar puncture and serologic studies were not performed.
With the differential diagnosis of neoplastic lesion, the patient was taken up for posterior laminectomy. L2-3 laminectomy was done. A dural bulge was identified. On durotomy, the cord was found to be enlarged. Under microscopic guidance, posterior longitudinal myelotomy was done, the cysts were approached, and subtotal resection of cysts was done. Intraoperatively, three grayish white cysts were identified. Cysts were found to be adherent to the nerve roots causing their inflammation. As a result, one of the cysts could not be excised and was only decompressed. The remaining two cysts were completely excised. Histopathology revealed it to be NCC.
The patient improved postoperatively. Back pain was relieved, and there was significant reduction in radiating pain. He was started on albendazole (15 mg/kg body weight) for 4 weeks and steroids for 2 weeks. The patient was discharged on the 4th post-operative day. He was followed-up biweekly for the first month.

6,"An 88-year-old woman (height, 150 cm; weight, 41 kg) with no history of drug allergy or general anesthesia was scheduled for transfemoral TAVI because of severe aortic stenosis (AS). The surgery was performed under general anesthesia to facilitate the use of transesophageal echocardiography and to manage any intraoperative complications. She was taking 0.625 mg/day bisoprolol, a selective β-1 blocker, for hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation. Additionally, she was taking amlodipine for hypertension. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography showed severe AS (aortic valve peak flow velocity: 4.73 m/s; mean aortic valve pressure gradient: 47 mmHg; aortic valve area: 0.41 cm2) and myocardial hypertrophy (left ventricular posterior wall thickness and interventricular septum thickness: 14 mm).
Pre-anesthetic medication for sedation was not administered. She received bisoprolol and amlodipine 3 h before entering the operating room. Figure shows the anesthesia record. General anesthesia was induced using midazolam and remifentanil; additionally, rocuronium was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation. She received total intravenous anesthesia: continuous infusions of propofol and remifentanil. Noradrenaline and dopamine were infused continuously through the central venous catheter to maintain blood pressure. AS disappeared after valve implantation. During the surgery, complete atrioventricular block occurred, and ventricular pacing (VVI mode: 60 ppm) was initiated. No other complications were associated with the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, she received 100 mg sugammadex through the central venous catheter, but 2 min later, her systolic arterial blood pressure (ABP) decreased unexpectedly to less than 40 mmHg. Simultaneously, ventilator monitoring revealed elevated peak and plateau airway pressures (60 and 40 cmH2O, respectively). No skin rash was observed on the body surface. Transthoracic echocardiography showed underfilling of the left ventricle without right ventricular dilatation or pericardial effusion. No abnormalities were observed in left ventricular wall motion.
The patient developed distributive shock, which was clinically diagnosed as anaphylactic shock caused by sugammadex because of the rapid onset of severe hypotension and bronchospasm. First, two boluses of 0.05 mg adrenaline were administered through the central venous catheter, followed by rapid volume resuscitation using crystalloid (1 L infusion within 30 min). The dose of noradrenaline was increased to 0.3 μg/kg/min. Consequently, the airway pressures returned to the original level, but the hypotension persisted. Thereafter, adrenaline was administered via bolus (0.1 mg twice) and continuous infusion (0.1 μg/kg/min); however, the increase in her ABP was minimal. Therefore, 1 mg glucagon was administered intravenously, and her systolic ABP immediately rose to 130 mmHg. An erythematous rash also appeared on her neck with the increase in ABP. Her general condition was stable after the therapeutic interventions. Ventricular pacing was continued because bradycardia with complete atrioventricular block was persistent during the interventions. She was admitted to the intensive care unit under tracheal intubation. Subsequently, the continuous infusion of adrenaline was discontinued, and the continuous infusion of noradrenaline was reduced. We also administered 125 mg methylprednisolone for 3 days. She was extubated 9 h after the onset of anaphylaxis, and circulatory agonists were discontinued the following day. She was discharged without complications on postoperative day 9. Blood tests revealed a total serum tryptase level of 7.3 ng/mL and 1.2 ng/mL at 1 h and 24 h after onset, respectively. We advised the patient to undergo allergy tests, such as skin prick tests or intradermal tests, to identify the cause of anaphylaxis. However, the patient refused these tests because she was elderly and unlikely to undergo surgery under general anesthesia in the future.

7,"A 54-year-old man with a history of excessive intake of alcohol (100 g/day × 30 years) and locally grown tobacco use (500g/month × 30 years) was admitted to our hospital because of chronic persistent swallowing dysfunction for six months. White light endoscopy (WLE) revealed a 22 mm flat lesion in the middle esophagus.The lesion was covered with scattered leukoplakia, and normal vascular network could not be seen in the lesion (Fig. a). Narrow-band imaging (NBI) under endoscopy revealed the lesion with an indistinct brownish area, local white penniform area, and white tiny papillary surface structure (Fig. b). Further low and high magnifying endoscopy with NBI (ME-NBI) showed tiny irregular papillary microsurface structure with various shapes and sizes, and non-typical type B1 pattern of intraepithelial papillary capillary loops (IPCL) confined to the papillary microsurface structure (Fig. c, low magnification, and Fig. d, high magnification) according to the classification of Japan Esophagus Society (JES classification) []. Iodine staining endoscopy revealed a less-stained lesion (Fig. e) and showed more distinct white tiny papillary surface structure (Fig. f) than conventional WLE. Biopsy showed a low grade intraepithelial neoplasia. Chest and abdominal CT scan revealed no abnormal lesions.
According to the endoscopic manifestations under WLE, ME-NBI, and iodine staining endoscopy, combining with pathology, we considered the lesion to be early esophageal cancer. Therefore we chose endoscopic therapy. The lesion was completely resected with endoscopic submucosal dissection. Histopathology showed that the layer of neoplastic spinous cells was significantly thickened (Fig. a) with local keratosis presenting the appearance of the so-called church spire (Fig. b). The lamina propria papilla was elongated upward to the surface layer (Fig. c), and the nuclei in the basal region had double or more nucleoli. Tumor cell displayed expanding growth, and partial tumor cells broke through the basement barrier and invaded into superficial lamina propria (Fig. d). The IPCL were observed in lamina propria papilla with elongating upward to the surface layer growing underneath the layer of neoplastic spinous cells, which corresponds to the IPCL observed by ME-NBI (Fig. e). The lesion was histopathologically confirmed as early VCCE which was limited within the mucosal lamina propria (m2) and completely resected. There were no lymphovascular and neural invasions of cancer cells, and no cancer cells to be seen in the lateral and vertical margin of the resected specimen (the distance of the lesion to the closest margin of the resected specimen was 3.012mm) (Fig. ).",endoscopic therapy,most appropriate management of selected conditions,"A middle-aged man with a substantial history of alcohol and tobacco use was admitted to the hospital due to chronic swallowing difficulties that persisted for six months.

8,"On October 2016, a 66-year-old woman, never smoker, underwent upper left lung lobectomy and regional lymph adenectomy, for a pulmonary mass discovered on radiological examination for shoulder pain present for a long time.
The gross examination of the surgical specimens showed an intraparenchymal, subpleural, whitish mass, measuring 8.5 cm in greatest dimension. Histologically, a well-circumscribed neoplasia composed of two different morphological components, which were separated in some areas and intermingled in others, was documented. The first component represented about 70% of the tumor burden and consisted of an organoid proliferation of polygonal, shaped uniform tumor cells with nuclei with finely granular chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli, consistent with carcinoid. Four mitosis/2 mm2 and diffuse, punctate necrosis were identified. The second component, representing about 30% of the tumor burden, showed a glandular architecture corresponding to acinar pattern of PA. Neoplastic infiltration of parietal pleura was documented (PL3). Immunoreactivity for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, TTF-1, and pan-cytokeratins (AE1-3 clone) was observed in carcinoid component, while glandular component was positive only for TTF-1 and cytokeratins; cytokeratin 7 was selectively expressed in the adenocarcinomatous component (). Metastatis constituted by both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine component was found in four out of six hilar lymph nodes, showing the same immunoreactivity in different neoplastic areas such as primitive lesion (). Immunoreactivity for ALK and ROS1 resulted negative in both component, in primitive tumor and in lymph nodal metastasis. TPS for PD-L1 was <1% in both component, in primitive tumor and in lymph nodal metastasis. A final diagnosis of “combined pulmonary adenocarcinoma with atypical carcinoid” was made with stage pT3 (PL3) pN2 sec UICC 2017. Each neoplastic component in both primitive and metastatic lesions was individually microdissected from unstained FFPE slides for DNA and RNA extraction. Targeted NGS analysis on Ion Torrent NGS platform was performed using the Ocav3 panel.
Among the 161 investigated genes, both common and private genes mutations were identified in each investigated entity of primary and metastatic sites (). No shared point mutations, CNVs, or gene fusions were identified in both adenocarcinoma and carcinoid components from any sites (S1/S2 and mL1/mL2). By contrast, one somatic mutation in the PTEN gene (p.Thr319Ter) was detected specifically in the adenocarcinoma components of both primary and metastatic sites (S2 and mL2), whereas the carcinoid component of both sites shared one somatic mutation in the NF1 gene (p.Arg1325Thr). Primary carcinoid S1 showed one private somatic mutation in the CDK12 gene (p.Arg44Leu), whereas the adenocarcinoma component of metastatic site showed a private mutation in the NOTCH1 gene (p.Pro498Arg).

His clinical examination apart from icterus was normal. Investigations revealed a direct hyperbilirubinemia of 3.3 mg/dL. Ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic lesion in head of pancreas 3 cm × 3 cm in size with dilated common bile duct and intrahepatic biliary radical dilatation.
A pancreatic protocol contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan was performed which confirmed the ultrasound findings as shown in
. In addition to this, it showed a replaced right hepatic artery arising from superior mesenteric artery (SMA) as shown in
, and a reversal of relationship of superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and SMA, that is, the artery to the right of vein was seen as shown in
. The complete vascular anatomy is schematically shown in
. The duodenojejunal flexure was in midline. There was no significant lymphadenopathy, no liver lesions, and no free fluid. These findings were suggestive of pancreatic head adenocarcinoma with incomplete intestinal rotation and an rRHA arising from SMA. Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9) was elevated at 196 U/mL (normal: < 37 U/mL) and Carcinoembryonic antigen was normal. A pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was planned for the patient.
During surgery, the small bowel loops were found clumped in right upper abdomen and a Kocher's maneuver was carefully performed after interbowel adhesiolysis to free all the loops till the third part of duodenum. SMA and SMV were then identified and looped at the lower border of pancreas. Hepatoduodenal ligament dissection was then performed to identify the replaced right hepatic artery and the main portal vein. The retropancreatic tunnel was created in a plane above the portal vein superiorly and the SMA inferiorly, and then the plane was widened till the area above SMV (

12,"A 57-year-old man with NASH without cirrhosis presented to a satellite hospital with acute onset of painless hematochezia for 1 day. He had unprovoked deep venous thrombosis with a negative hypercoagulable workup and portal-vein thrombosis on Apixaban diagnosed 18 months prior to presentation. He was tachycardic and mildly hypotensive. There was no evidence of chronic liver disease on exam. The hemoglobin level was 130 g/L and subsequently decreased to 80 g/L, while the platelet count was 160 × 109/L. Laboratory tests revealed the following values: INR, 1.13; lactate, 1 mmol/L; albumin, 3.7 g/dl; and liver enzymes were within normal limits. Anticoagulation was discontinued and he was resuscitated using intravenous (IV) crystalloids. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed small non-bleeding esophageal varices. Colonoscopy revealed a complex ascending colonic varix with active bleeding ().
He was treated with IV octreotide at the satellite hospital at which he presented and then transferred to our tertiary institution for escalation of care. Liver-protocol computed tomography (CT) was performed for TIPS evaluation and revealed a steatotic liver and collateralized chronically thrombosed SMV with patent portal vein. He was deemed not to be a candidate for either TIPS or BRTO in the setting of chronic SMV thrombosis. Colonic resection was not recommended, since it was unlikely to prevent future bleeding with significant collaterals.
He continued to have hematochezia with Hgb nadir of 78 g/L. A trans-hepatic portogram performed by interventional radiology revealed an elevated absolute portal pressure of 18 mmHg. Digital subtraction images confirmed the site of the SMV occlusion at the confluence of two large SMV branches, in addition to retrograde flow through the large right CV. The occluded SMV was cannulated through a left patent branch using a 4-French angled glide catheter and a stiff Glidewire. A Cobra 2 catheter and a stiff Glidewire were used to cannulate the right SMV branch at the confluence. Recanalization of the occluded SMV () was achieved by using 5 × 40 mm balloon angioplasty to 5 mm, then two overlapping 10 × 40 mm self-expanding stents were successfully deployed into the origin of the right SMV branch, extending proximally into the portal splenic confluence. The stents were then post-dilated using balloon angioplasty to 8 and 10 mm. Follow-up venography showed antegrade flow in the right SMV branch into the SMV stent with a marked reduction in filling of the right CV (). The procedure was terminated after restoration of the SMV flow and the portal pressure was not measured post-procedurally. Liver biopsy showed steatohepatitis with stage 2/4 fibrosis.

13,"A two-year-old female, previously healthy and normally developing, presented with a six-week history of macrocephaly and truncal and peripheral ataxia. An eye examination showed a lack of papilledema but was suspicious for mild peripheral loss of vision. Her past medical history was unremarkable. She did not have diencephalic syndrome at presentation. An urgent brain MRI demonstrated the presence of a large lobulated multicompartmental supra-sellar mass centered within the hypothalamus/optic chiasm (5.4cm x 3.4cm x 5cm) (Figure ), with extension into the surrounding structures and mass effect on the midbrain and third ventricle causing obstructive hydrocephalus. She initially underwent an endoscopic biopsy and septostomy, along with a right-sided ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt to manage her hydrocephalus. The pathology of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of a low-grade glioma (LGG) that was BRAF-V600E negative on immunohistochemistry but positive on next-generation sequencing (Figure ). She was started on chemotherapy with vincristine and carboplatin, but unfortunately she had rapid tumor progression with worsening hydrocephalus six weeks into chemotherapy. This progression caused the patient to develop further complications, including progressive right-sided hemiparesis, bitemporal hemianopia, central hypothyroidism, and feeding difficulties requiring a gastrostomy tube and placement of a second VP shunt. After extensive discussions and mutual expert consensus, her chemotherapy was stopped, and she was started on the novel targeted agent dabrafenib (5.25mg/kg/day). By three months of starting dabrafenib, the size of her tumor decreased by more than 70% (2.5cm x 3.5cm x 2.7cm), with continued decline until plateauing after two years of therapy (Figure ). Prior to dabrafenib, the patient had marked motor and speech impairments but is now able to perform all age-appropriate developmental skills independently. She no longer requires tube feeding and has been growing well. Her bitemporal hemianopia has improved markedly. Her visual acuity is the only symptom that has not shown significant recovery, as she continues to have low but stable visual acuity bilaterally.

15,"The patient was a 48-year-old male who had been undergoing regular dilatations for the last 8 years for sustaining relief from his urethral stricture. He had a history of having undergone open suprapubic cystostomy (SPC) 8 years ago for acute urinary retention secondary to recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI). He developed surgical site infection (SSI) postoperatively which was managed conservatively. The stricture had been managed with internal optic urethrotomy (IOU) and serial dilatations, following which the patient started doing well with 6 monthly dilatations.
Since last 2 years, he developed a swelling in the right inguinoscrotal region associated with repeated thinning of urinary stream and recurrent episodes of burning micturition. The swelling became static and persistent in the last 2 months.
On examination, there was a 5-cm long vertical midline scar in the suprapubic region. An irreducible soft swelling of 8 cm × 6 cm was present in the right inguinal region which extended up to the base of scrotum. Cough impulse was present, and we could not get above the swelling. The defect could not be localized. There was also a gradual growing difficulty in negotiating urethral dilators due to the path distortion by the contents of the hernia. Cystoscopy revealed narrowing in bulbar urethra with deviations in the proximal anterior urethra and the scope needed to be negotiated to reach the urinary bladder. Ultrasound showed findings consistent with right inguinal omentocele and a scarred suprapubic region. Defect could not be localized.
The patient had been coaxed for surgery multiple times but he did not agree due to poor past surgical experience. He eventually landed with difficulty in micturition and inability to get dilators passed. A preoperative diagnosis of right sided, complete, irreducible, inguinal omentocele with urethral stricture was made, and the patient was planned for right open hernioplasty with cystourethroscopy along with IOU.
Intraoperatively, a right indirect hernial sac with omentum as content was found; the sac was opened, omentum resected, and sac was transfixed at its neck followed by posterior wall strengthening. Another hernial sac with omentum as content was found in midline beneath the scar of old SPC which was densely adherent to the surrounding fibrotic tissue (
). This sac was dissected out, opened, content resected, and sac was closed. For the right inguinal hernia, a mesh hernioplasty was done. After the closure of the external oblique aponeurosis, anatomical repair of midline defect was achieved and strengthening was done with overlay mesh covering the midline defect. On cystourethroscopy, a stricture was present from posterior part of penile urethra to bulbar urethra. IOU was done and 18-Fr Foley's catheter left in situ.
A postoperative diagnosis of right-sided, complete, irreducible, indirect inguinal hernia, and incisional hernia with omentum as contents with urethral stricture was made. The patient developed SSI on post operative day (POD)-2 which was managed by wound irrigation and oral antibiotics.
At follow-up after 1 month, a repeat cystourethroscopy was performed which showed fibrosis and narrowing at the site of IOU. A repeat IOU was done. The anterior urethra had straightened out and dilatation was simple and smooth. The patient now has a good urinary stream, no complaint of restriction in passage and dilatations have become a smooth affair.

Serological markers including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (95 mm/hour) and procalcitonin (25.2 ng/mL) were higher. X-ray of the chest was grossly normal (Figure ), and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the neck revealed irregular, well-defined, hypodense, non-enhancing area in the right parotid gland with extension into the neck spaces, larynx, and subcutaneous planes (Figure ). CECT of the chest revealed mild effusion in bilateral pleural space secondary to acute infection and no evidence of lymphadenopathy or osteomyelitis (Figures , ).
Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining from pleural fluid was negative for acid-fast bacillus (AFB bacilli). The patient was managed in the intensive care unit with ventilator support due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. He was diagnosed with acute progressive necrotizing fasciitis with multiple organ dysfunction syndromes due to an unknown cause of septicemia. He underwent multiple aggressive debridements of the neck and chest wall (Figure ).
The cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) and ZN staining revealed positive mycobacteria and AFB bacilli for pathological tissue. Therefore, the pus collected in the parotid region and neck space was likely secondary to tubercular infection. A split-thickness graft was applied in multiple fractions after three weeks of anti-tubercular chemotherapy. The patient had a long hospital stay due to the difficult location and complexity of the ulcer over the neck. He was followed up for six months in good clinical condition after discharge.",ZN staining,interprets laboratory or other study findings,"A 22-year-old male patient came for an emergency consultation due to sudden swelling and redness on the right side of his neck and chest wall, which developed over three days. He was semi-conscious, had rapid breathing and pulse, low blood pressure, and decreased urine output.

Chest X-ray appeared normal, but contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the neck displayed a hypodense area in the right parotid gland extending into the neck spaces, larynx, and subcutaneous planes. CECT of the chest showed mild pleural effusion. Initial Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining from pleural fluid was negative for acid-fast bacillus. However, after the patient underwent several aggressive debridements, the cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) and ZN staining indicated the presence of mycobacteria and acid-fast bacilli in the pathological tissue, suggesting a tubercular infection.Based on the patient's symptoms, lab results, imaging studies, and the presence of mycobacteria and acid-fast bacilli in the pathological tissue, what is the most likely diagnosis?","{'A': 'acute progressive necrotizing fasciitis secondary to a tubercular infection', 'B': 'streptococcal cellulitis', 'C': 'tubercular lymphadenitis', 'D': 'staphylococcal skin infection', 'E': 'tuberculous meningitis', 'F': 'parotid gland abscess', 'G': 'clostridium perfringens soft tissue infection'}",acute progressive necrotizing fasciitis secondary to a tubercular infection,A
18,"A 41-year-old Japanese woman presented to our clinic with a 4 month history of bilateral groin pain and right buttock pain. Her right hip was more painful than her left hip. There was no history of trauma, alcohol abuse, or steroid use. Her medical history included iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed 2 years earlier, after which she had been on iron supplements. She had no fracture episodes, including fragility fractures.
Her height, body weight, and body mass index were 155 cm, 42 kg, and 18.7 kg/m2, respectively. She was able to walk for approximately 10 minutes without a stick, albeit at a slow speed. Limitations in the passive motion of her bilateral hip joint were observed thus: flexion, 100°, internal rotation 5°, external rotation 15°, and abduction 20°, on both sides. She was able to perform a straight-leg raise of the right limb with substantial pain. The neurovascular status of both lower extremities was intact. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association scoring system for the evaluation of hip-joint function (JOA hip score) was 46 points for her right hip and 56 points for her left hip. The score was based on a total of 100 points, comprising 40 for pain, 20 for range of motion, 20 for the ability to walk, and 20 for activities of daily living [].
Standard radiographs of both hips (Fig. a–c) demonstrated no characteristic findings such as the crescent sign, sclerotic band pattern, and collapse of the femoral head, and no joint space narrowing was seen in either femoral head. MRI of both hips (Fig. d, e) presented a low signal line in the subchondral region of the femoral head in the T1 weighted image and high signal region in almost all of the femoral head in the short tau inversion recovery (STIR). The oblique axial views of the proton density-weighted image showed a low-signal sinuous line in the anteromedial region of the femoral head (Fig. ). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) values were low in both femoral necks. Bone mineral density was 0.909 g/cm2 (T-score –0.9, Z-score −0.8) in the lumbar spine, 0.594 g/cm2 (T-score −1.8, Z-score −1.4) in the right femoral neck, and 0.529 g/cm2 (T-score −2.4, Z-score −2.0) in the left femoral neck. Laboratory findings were as follows: C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.03 mg/dl (normal range: 0–0.5 mg/dl); alkaline phosphatase 608 IU/l (40–150 IU/l); calcium 9.0 mg/dl (8.4–10.2 mg/dl); albumin 4.4 g/d (3.9–4.9 g/d); and hemoglobin 9.7 g/dl (12–16 g/dl). Bone turnover markers were as follows: tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP-5b) 463 mU/dl (premenopausal normal range: 120–420 mU/dl) and total procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (Total P1NP) 72.7 ng/ml (26.4–98.2 ng/ml). We diagnosed bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head and classified it as stage 1 in both femoral heads, according to the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) classification [].
The patient was instructed not to take as much weight as possible using sticks on the right side. Her symptoms improved immediately. However, 6 months later, her symptoms increased slightly without any traumatic episodes. Radiographic findings indicated almost no change (Fig. a–c). However, a slight signal change in the medial subcapital region was observed in the MRI scan (Fig. d, e). Her pain gradually increased thereafter, and 10 months after her first visit, walking became difficult. The JOA hip score decreased to 34 points in both hips; still, no changes could be observed in the radiograph (Fig. a–c). MRI of both hips showed a nondisplaced subcapital fracture on the medial side of both femoral necks, with bone marrow edema around the fracture (Fig. d, e). Because the cause of the fractures was not identified, the DEXA and bone turnover markers were measured again, and 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D was measured for the first time. All DEXA values decreased. The bone mineral density was 0.849 g/cm2 (T-score −1.5, Z-score −1.2) in the lumbar spine, 0.527 g/ cm2 (T-score −2.4, Z-score −2.1) in the right femoral neck, and 0.490 g/cm2 (T-score −2.7, Z-score −2.4) in the left femoral neck. TRACP-5b level increased to 607 mU/dl, and total P1NP decreased to 52.7 ng/ml. Her 25(OH) vitamin D level was 11.1 ng/dL and she was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. Based on the above results, our diagnosis was bilateral stress fracture of the femoral neck secondary to osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The patient underwent internal fixation of both hips with sliding hip screws (Dual SC screw system; Kisco, Kobe, Japan) to stabilize the stress fractures. In addition, the reaming performed before inserting of the sliding hip screw served as core decompression for the femoral heads [, ]. The specimens obtained from the reaming were examined histologically. Definitive findings of osteonecrosis such as bone marrow necrosis and loss of osteocyte nuclei in the femoral heads were observed (Fig. ). Postoperative radiographs showed no evidence of displacement of the fractures (Fig. ). We administered eldecalcitol 0.75 μg per day orally for vitamin D deficiency, and daily subcutaneous injections of teriparatide acetate. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient began to bear weight as tolerated with the use of an assistive device bilaterally. One month postoperatively, she was able to walk without pain and used a cane part time. She eventually regained full walking ability without a cane 3 months after surgery. Furthermore, her JOA hip score improved to 90 points in both hip joints at 5 months after surgery. Radiographs showed no evidence of recurrent stress fracture in the femoral neck or progression of osteonecrosis (Fig. ). Sequential oblique axial MRI showed that the necrotic region of the femoral head had decreased 5 months after surgery (Fig. ).",surgical management for osteonecrosis of the femoral head,appropriate surgical management,"A 41-year-old Japanese woman with a history of iron-deficiency anemia presented with a 4 month history of bilateral groin pain and right buttock pain.

However, MRI of both hips displayed a low signal line in the subchondral region of the femoral head and a high signal region in almost all of the femoral head. The patient was diagnosed with bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head. After 10 months, the patient's pain increased, making walking difficult. An MRI showed a nondisplaced subcapital fracture on the medial side of both femoral necks. After diagnosing the patient with bilateral stress fracture of the femoral neck secondary to osteonecrosis of the femoral head, she underwent internal fixation of both hips with sliding hip screws to stabilize the stress fractures.

19,"A 35-year-old male patient presented with a six-month history of pain in the anterior chest and neck. His pain initially had been mild but had become severe in the last three weeks. He was afebrile and did not have any constitutional symptoms. On examination, marked tenderness of the right sternoclavicular joint was noted. Initial laboratory investigations, tuberculosis workup, and chest X-rays were unremarkable. However, further study with MRI revealed subchondral bone marrow edema and enhancement involving the medial end of the right clavicle. In addition, mild effusion of the right sternoclavicular joint and surrounding soft-tissue edema was also seen (Figure , ).
Given the patient's radiological and clinical findings, suspicion of SAPHO syndrome was raised. He was given an initial trial of paracetamol and NSAIDs and he showed remarkable improvement on his monthly follow-up visits. Though a biopsy was offered, the patient refused to undergo one and has shown no relapse to date thanks to the dramatic response to NSAIDs.",NSAIDs,most appropriate management of selected conditions,"A 35-year-old male patient presented with severe anterior chest and neck pain that had been progressively worsening over a six-month period.

The patient was started on paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), to which he responded remarkably well, showing improvement at his monthly follow-up visits.

20,"A 66-year-old male with back pain and cough for two weeks was admitted to the First Hospital of Jiaxing on 8 August 2019. A thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan revealed that the malignant tumor on the left upper lobe was complicated by distal obstructive inflammation, the enlargement of the left hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and the multiple bone metastases on 25 August 2019 (Fig. A). Immunohistochemical (IHC) results of the posterior iliac bone marrow biopsy specimen showed the positive expression of CD3, CD20, CD34, CD235a, and NPO, and the negative CD61 expression. IHC results of an endoscopic biopsy specimen of the bronchial mucosa on the upper left lobe showed the positive expression of TTF1, CK7, NapsinA, Ki67, CK, and EMA, and the negative expression of CK5/6, P40, CgA, Syn, and CD45 on 6 September 2019. Histopathologic observations showed infiltration of atypia cells in mucosal and fibrous tissues. The detection tools of pathology and cytology included automatic IHC staining (BenchMark XT, Roche, The United States), digital slice scanner, image analysis software (Pannoramic 250, 3DHistech, Hungary), and microscope (Eclipse Ci-S, Nikon, Japan). Finally, the patient was diagnosed with stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma combing with bone metastases.
To seek potential therapeutic opportunities, the FFPE tissue and control sample (white blood cell) of the patient were detected using a 733-gene NGS panel in a College of American Pathologists (CAP) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certificated lab. Sequencing reads were mapped against the hg19/GRCh37 genome, and duplicate reads were removed, followed by variants calling in targeted regions using an in-house developed bioinformatics algorithm. The algorithm utilized a filtering model containing background error correction, strand bias, base quality, mapping quality, short tandem repeat regions, and low-quality mapping ratio 25 []. The NGS analysis results indicated that the patient had an EGFR exon 19 p.L747_S752del somatic mutation with an allelic fraction of 73.19% and TP53 p.H179L germline mutation. Besides, the whole chromosome 7 and 5q deletion were detected using NGS-based copy number variation (CNV) analyses (Fig. ), which were classical abnormalities associated with MDS. According to the clinical inquiry, the patient was a farmer by occupation, which means that he has long been exposed to certain chemicals such as pesticides, fertilizers, and solvents containing benzene. In addition, he smoked for 40 years. Taking all these findings together, we suspected the patient with secondary MDS. The results of the physiological blood indexes and the bone marrow aspiration test showed a decrease of platelet counts and the elevation of myelocyte counts. The proportion of blast was 5%, and the morphology of the cells presented the characteristics of MDS, which further confirmed our speculation (Fig. and Additional file : Fig. S1).
In terms of treatment, the EGFR-positive mutation patient was administered with gefitinib starting from 20 August 2019. Due to decreasing platelet counts, azacitidine was administrated for four courses of treatment. However, the thrombocytopenia had not been significantly improved, and the size of the maximal tumor in the lung lesion did not decrease after seven months’ treatment (Fig. B). On 10 April 2020, a pathological report showed the infiltration of poorly differentiated cancer cells into the fibrous tissue. IHC results suggested the neuroendocrine tumor, in which small cell carcinoma and atypical carcinoid tumor accounted for about 40% and 60%, respectively. On 7 April and 28 April 2020, considering positive PD-L1 expression and high tumor mutation burden (TMB) in the tissue sample, the patient was administrated with toripalimab (a PD-1 inhibitor) and bevacizumab. Platelet counts returned to near-normal levels gradually, and the tumor lesion shrank obviously (Fig. ). It was concluded that the patient reached a partial response (PR) (Fig. C). The progression-free survival was four months.",e.g. targeted therapy,most appropriate management of selected conditions,"A 66-year-old male with a two-week history of back pain and cough was diagnosed with stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma with bone metastases. Despite treatments with gefitinib and azacitidine, the patient did not show significant improvement. Further analysis revealed EGFR mutation and TP53 germline mutation, along with whole chromosome 7 and 5q deletions related to Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS). The patient was then administered with Toripalimab, a PD-1 inhibitor, and Bevacizumab, which resulted in near-normal platelet counts and significant reduction in the tumor size.After the initial treatment showed no significant improvement, which combination therapy showed a positive response in the patient diagnosed with Stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma and secondary MDS?","{'A': 'crizotinib and alectinib', 'B': 'pembrolizumab and nivolumab', 'C': 'surgery and radiation therapy', 'D': 'erlotinib and osimertinib', 'E': 'toripalimab and bevacizumab', 'F': 'pemetrexed and carboplatin'}",toripalimab and bevacizumab,E
21,"A 90-year-old male was found in his home slumped to his right side and unable to be awakened. Paramedics calculated an 8/15 Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, which remained the same on admission. On presentation to the hospital, the patient had left facial droop, bilateral pinpoint pupils, and right-sided weakness. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission was 26, suggesting a severe stroke. All other observations on admission were non-revealing, including vital signs, biochemical tests, and systems review.
The patient’s neurological medical history included two previous transient ischemic attacks and suspected dementia. Other past medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, adult polycystic kidney disease, hypercholesterolemia, and aortic valve sclerosis. He was an ex-smoker of unknown pack-years and prior to admission was living independently.
Initial head CT performed only showed chronic small vessel disease with periventricular leukoaraiosis, consistent with his age. Thrombolysis was initiated with an intravenous tissue-plasminogen activator, however, the patient’s GCS declined to 6/15 approximately 40 minutes after the start of thrombolysis. A repeat head CT was performed, again showing no acute findings. To prevent further deterioration, a decision to monitor the patient’s condition conservatively was made.
Over the next few days, the patient remained very somnolent. When the patient was able to awaken, he was only capable of responding to simple commands. Speech and language therapists noted that fatigue was limiting conversations, with the patient speaking with imprecise articulation and at a low volume. Occupational therapists concurred that the patient was poorly engaged during sessions, while physiotherapists classified this patient as having limited rehabilitation potential.
Stroke was finally confirmed upon a third head CT several days after admission, which showed bilateral thalamic infarcts. Other findings included hyperdensity at the basilar tip and left posterior cerebral artery, likely due to wall calcification of vessels. An MRI revealed bilateral hyperintensities in the thalami, consistent with acute bilateral thalamic stroke, with small left parietal cortical infarction (Figure ).
Imaging also confirmed the arterial location of the infarction, a single branch of the pre-communicating (P1) segment of the left posterior cerebral artery known as the artery of Percheron (AOP). Over the next month, the patient participated in multidisciplinary rehabilitation sessions. He had a gradual return of physical function and with it, his sense of humor returned, much to the delight of his family and the attending staff. He was unable to care for himself independently and was eventually discharged to a care home. Six months later, he was mobile with a walking stick and had a reasonable quality of life. One year after the initial presentation to the hospital, he passed away from an intercurrent chest infection.",rule out intracranial hemarrhage before thrombolysis,immediate management or priority in management,"A 90-year-old male with a history of two previous transient ischemic attacks, suspected dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, adult polycystic kidney disease, hypercholesterolemia, and aortic valve sclerosis was found in his home, unresponsive and slumped to his right side. He had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8/15 and displayed left facial droop, bilateral pinpoint pupils, and right-sided weakness. His National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 26, indicating a severe stroke. He was started on thrombolysis with an intravenous tissue-plasminogen activator after an initial head CT scan showed only chronic small vessel disease. However, his condition worsened, leading to a more conservative approach in monitoring his condition. Further imaging confirmed the stroke, which was localized to the artery of Percheron.

22,"A 14-year-old male adolescent presented to the emergency department with subfebrile temperatures for 1 week and localized pain in his right popliteal fossa for 3 days. Prior to the onset of these symptoms, he had been immobilized for several days following a minor sports injury.
The adolescent had no permanent medication and no prior medical history except for an asymptomatic ATD diagnosed at the age of six by functional antithrombin assay (antithrombin activity of 57%, age adapted reference: 77–125%). Since at that time, there were no clinical signs of thrombosis, the diagnosis of ATD did not lead to any therapeutic consequences. Screening for ATD at this early age had been carried out on parental request, as his mother was diagnosed with ATD in her early adulthood. Interestingly, his mother now reported that she had very recently been diagnosed with IVCA (preexisting chromogenic test results showed an antithrombin activity of 50% for the mother, the age adjusted reference range being 80 to 130%).
The coexistence of other hereditary thrombophilic disorders in our patient and his mother (protein S deficiency, protein C deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin-mutation, antiphospholipid syndrome) was ruled out by respective laboratory analyses.
Laboratory blood analysis in the emergency department showed markedly elevated D-dimers of 25 mg/l FEU (reference: < 0.5 mg/l FEU) and of C-reactive protein (CrP) of 184 mg/l (reference < 5 mg/l). Antithrombin activity on admission was reduced to 61% (age adjusted reference 83–118%).
A vascular ultrasound examination upon admission confirmed the clinically suspected thrombosis of the right lower extremity involving the external iliac, common and superficial femoral as well as the popliteal vein. The ultrasound examination of the left lower extremity veins did not give evidence of thromboses upon admission. The patient was treated with continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin at a therapeutical dose including several bolus administrations and antithrombin (4000 IE within the first 36 h) was substituted reaching levels in the target range between 80 and 100%. Subsequent monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) showed an insufficient response to heparin treatment (aPTT was 29 s before the administration of heparin and did not exceed a maximum value of 33.6 s during heparin treatment). The anticoagulative therapy was therefore switched to direct thrombin inhibition by argatroban at a dose of 1.5–2.0 μg/kg/min, which led to target aPTT values of 50–60s.
Due to the elevated CrP levels and subfebrile temperatures, empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous cefuroxim was initiated.
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan on day three confirmed a complete DVT of the right lower extremity, and now additionally extended thromboses of the left lower extremity and thrombosis of both iliac vessels. Furthermore, it revealed an occlusion of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with prominent venous lumbar collaterals, suggestive of IVCA. Surrounding the lumbar vertebrae, several of these collaterals appeared to be fully thrombotic, which was confirmed by angiography (Fig. A).
The following day, a catheter-directed local thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) at a daily dose of 0.25 mg/kg was initiated in both extremities and carried out for a total of 48 h. For the right leg, an additional ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis using the EKOS® system was performed.
During hospitalization, the anticoagulative therapy was switched from argatroban to the vitamin K antagonist phenprocoumon with a target International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.0–2.5. Oral anticoagulation will most likely be continued lifelong due to the combination of extended multilocal thromboses with underlying ATD, as well as IVCA, which in itself is a risk factor for thrombosis.
The patient was discharged on day eight after hospital admission. An ultrasound examination upon discharge showed full recanalization of the femoral and iliac veins of both legs.
During a routine follow-up 1 week later, the patient presented free of any clinical complaints. However, despite continued oral anticoagulation since hospital discharge, vascular ultrasound now revealed extended re-thrombosis of both the right and left pelvic axis and the right lower extremity, thus leading to a second hospital admission and re-induction of therapy with both intravenous antithrombin and catheter-directed thrombolysis.
Recanalization of the right lower extremity and pelvic axis was subsequently achieved, whereby IVC occlusion was confirmed (Fig. B). However, the left pelvic vessels remained thrombotic even after 5 days of catheter-directed thrombolysis.
Surprisingly, one of the angiographies allowed for location of the occluded area of the IVC by rendezvous-technique between the superior and inferior vena cava, which prior to this had been thought to be atretic (Fig. C). The vessel was successfully recanalized using balloon dilation and subsequent stenting (Fig. D).
Throughout the clinical stay, the patient’s oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon was intensified to a new target INR of 2.5–3.0 in order to prevent re-thrombosis.
The patient was discharged from hospital on day seven after admission. Regular follow-up examinations at our outpatient clinic did not give evidence for any new thrombotic events to date (time since first occurrence of thrombosis was 9 months).
Concerning the thrombotic left iliac vessels, a follow-up angiographic intervention relying on special equipment was performed, but recanalization could not be achieved.
Fortunately, the IVC of the patient’s mother could also be recanalized by angiographic intervention.",catheter-directed local thrombolysis,Selecting Clinical Interventions (Mixed Management),"A 14-year-old male with asymptomatic ATD presented with subfebrile temperatures and pain in the right popliteal fossa. Laboratory tests showed high levels of D-dimers and C-reactive protein. An ultrasound confirmed thrombosis in the right lower extremity.

However, MRI scans later revealed extensive thromboses, including occlusion of the IVC. The patient underwent several procedures, including catheter-directed local thrombolysis using rt-PA, and additional ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis in the right leg.

23,"A 72-year-old male, known hypertensive on medication, non-smoker, no family history of cancer presented with complaints of pain in the right hip with difficulty in walking in January 2019. On evaluation, a pathological fracture was found at the neck of the right femur. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine was done, which revealed osteophyte complexes at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6 vertebrae causing narrowing of neural foramina. Multiple T2-hyperintense lesions in lung parenchyma were an incidental finding. Upon further evaluation with positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan of the whole body, mass in the apex of the right lung, right hilum, mediastinal lymph node, soft tissue wall thickening in the proximal stomach along with multiple liver and bone metastases were found. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy revealed a proximal gastric growth from which a biopsy was taken. Histopathology showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. A provisional diagnosis of carcinoma stomach with distant metastasis was reached. But immunohistochemistry came out to be positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and cytokeratin-7 (CK-7), while negative for cytokeratin 20 (CK-20) (Figures -).
So, a possibility of metastasis from a lung primary was considered. It was confirmed by a biopsy from the lung mass that revealed adenocarcinoma as the histopathology. On immunohistochemistry, it was positive for TTF-1 and CK-7 while negative for CK-20 and synaptophysin. Analysis for anaplastic lymphoma kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor, and receptor tyrosine kinase 1 were all negative but programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) was 90%. So, the final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma lung with multiple lung, liver, femur, as well as gastric metastases.
For the pathological fracture, he underwent fixation by intramedullary nailing followed by palliative external beam radiotherapy 8 Gy in a single fraction. He received 10 three-weekly cycles each of Inj. pembrolizumab 200 mg as intravenous infusion and Inj. denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously from March 2019 to September 2019. An interim PET-CT scan done after four cycles of immunotherapy in June 2019 showed a near-complete metabolic response (Figures -).
After 10 cycles, Inj. pembrolizumab was discontinued as the patient was unwilling to continue due to personal reasons. He was then started with chemotherapy, Inj. pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and Inj. bevacizumab 15 mg/kg in October 2019. Following this, the patient developed grade 1 maculopapular rash, pedal edema, and grade 2 diarrhea, which were managed conservatively. After that the patient did not opt for the continuation of chemotherapy. The next visit of the patient was in February 2021 with complaints of cough and breathlessness. On re-evaluation with PET-CT scan, progressive disease was found in the primary site (Figures , ).
Palliative radiotherapy of 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the primary lesion was delivered through anteroposterior and posteroanterior portals of 10 megavolt energy each in April 2021 via linear accelerator (Elekta-Versa HD) which was tolerated well (Figure ).
In June, the patient developed an altered sensorium and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of brain revealed multiple brain metastases for which the patient received palliative whole-brain radiotherapy of 30 Gy in 10 fractions over two weeks from the same linear accelerator.

24,"A 68-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital on December 2, 2020, due to being “anxious and easily frightened for 3 months, psychomotor retardation, and affected by urinary incontinence for half a month.” The patient had no mental illness before and developed symptoms 3 months before admission. These included waking up early, being nervous and afraid for no apparent reason, and being fearful of leaving the house. The patient was upset, sensitive, and cried occasionally. In addition, the patient needed walking support (e.g., hands on the wall) at home to prevent falling. The patient had been hospitalized at a local mental health center 2 months prior to the present admission, where she was diagnosed with “GAD.” She received paroxetine (20 mg/d), tandospirone (30 mg/d), and oxazepam (15 mg/d). Her symptoms improved, and so she was discharged. She reported that she took the medications regularly according to the instructions. However, half a month prior to admission at our hospital, the patient experienced a relapse characterized by anxiety, fear, small steps while walking, reluctance to come out of her home, speaking less, and being slow to respond, as well as urinary incontinence. In addition, her social skills declined significantly, and the patient could not take care of herself independently. The patient had been diagnosed with type-II diabetes 4 years previously. No other comorbidities were reported. The patient had no abnormalities in her personal history, menstrual history, marriage and childbirth history, or family history.
Physical examination after admission revealed she had normal limb muscle strength and tone. The finger-to-nose, rapid alternating movement, heel-to-shin tests, and Romberg’s sign were normal. However, her gait was not stable and she took small steps. She was negative for pathological signs and meningeal irritation. In a psychological assessment, the patient exhibited clear consciousness, disorientation to place and time, passivity during interactions with few answers to questions, no hallucinations or delusions, a decline in memory and cognition; and a reduction in daily physical activities and energy levels. She felt distraught with a slight tremor in her hands.
Her level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 6.280 µIU/mL (0.270-4.200); and she was normal for total T3, total T4, free T3, and free T4. Her level of anti-thyroglobulin antibody (anti-Tg) was 235.60 IU/mL (<115.00), and that of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TPO) was 238.70 IU/mL (<34.00). A color Doppler ultrasound showed diffused thyroid lesions with nodular changes (nodules in the right lobe of the thyroid). Both a CT examination (Figure ) and an MRI (Figure ) of the head showed brain atrophy and leukoaraiosis. A chest CT and pelvic ultrasonography were normal. EEG recordings revealed diffuse slow waves. No epileptic activity or extreme delta brush was observed. The patient’s Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) score was 22, indicating moderate anxiety. Her Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score was 13, indicating a likelihood of depression. Her Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 14, indicating dementia.
The differential diagnosis was as follows: 1) rapidly progressive dementia, 2) type-II diabetes, and 3) subclinical hypothyroidism. After admission, the patient was treated with venlafaxine (75 mg/d) and oxazepam (15 mg/d). She showed a rapidly progressive decline in cognitive function, emotional dysregulation, paroxysmal body shaking, slow performance, abnormal gait, constipation, and urinary incontinence. However, the reason for the rapidly progressive dementia was unknown. Thus, lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid examination were performed with the following results: cerebrospinal fluid glucose: 6.30 mmol/L (2.50-4.50); protein: 0.87 g/L (0.15-0.45); and anti-glutamate receptor (NMDA) ratio: 1:3.2 (IgG).
Based on these results, the diagnosis was changed to AE. Accordingly, the patient was transferred to the neurology department and treated with immunoglobulin (IVIG, 20 g/d via intravenous infusion for 5 days) and methylprednisolone (1000 mg/d via intravenous infusion for 3 days). The dosage of methylprednisolone was dropped by half every 3 days (till 48 mg/d) and was given orally. After treatment, the patient showed a gradual recovery in cognitive and emotional function, her body shaking disappeared, and her gait was stable. Her EEG was normal. Both medications were stopped gradually. The patient was discharged 24 days after administration and had resumed a normal life without relapse at a 6-month follow-up.",immunoglobulin and corticosteroids,most appropriate management of selected conditions,"A 68-year-old woman, earlier diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and type-II diabetes, came with the complaints of rapid cognitive decline, increasing anxiety, fear, and urinary incontinence. Although she was on treatment for her GAD, her condition worsened over time. Investigations showed elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid antibodies. Brain imaging indicated signs of atrophy and leukoaraiosis, while EEG results displayed diffuse slow waves. Her cognitive function continued to decline despite being on venlafaxine and oxazepam. Lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid examination were performed, which led to a reconsideration of her diagnosis. Post-diagnosis, the treatment regimen was revised, leading to a significant improvement in her symptoms.What diagnosis was established that led to a change in the patient's treatment regimen?","{'A': 'autoimmune encephalitis', 'B': 'generalized anxiety disorder', 'C': 'vascular dementia', 'D': 'subclinical hypothyroidism', 'E': ""alzheimer's disease""}",autoimmune encephalitis,A
25,"A 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, essential hypertension, class 3 obesity, depression, and poor social and economic background was intermittently followed during the previous four years for persistent cutaneous candidiasis with intertrigo in the inframammary, inguinal, and lower abdominal regions (Figure ).
She had been treated with topical antifungal, oral fluconazole and oral itraconazole with no improvement, which was believed to be because of poor hygiene and questionable therapeutic compliance. A worsening in the skin rash with exudate, pruritus, and a change to a violaceous colour, with scaly papules and vesicles (Figures , ) led to the performance of a skin biopsy which revealed (Figure ) orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis in the epidermis with areas of parakeratosis and, in the papillary dermis, there was an infiltrate of cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and reniform nuclei that showed positive CD1a and S100 proteins on the immunohistochemistry and negative CD163 (Figure ).
The patient denied constitutional, musculoskeletal, neurological, or urinary complaints. She underwent a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), thoracic-abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT), and bone scintigraphy. Brain MRI depicted mild chronic microvascular changes in the white matter, unchanged from a prior study. CT demonstrated a thickening of the renal pelvis (4 mm) in the right kidney with a slight urothelial dilation (Figure ). The rest of the exams did not reveal further organ involvement.
After considering the skin histology, the extensive cutaneous involvement, and the infiltrative urothelial involvement, it was evident this was a multi-system process. A consultation with Hematology/Oncology, led to induction treatment with prednisolone and vinblastine-based chemotherapy. At six weeks of chemotherapy, there was a partial regression of the skin lesions (Figure ) and a resolution of the urothelium lesion in imaging exam (CT).
The disease was in continuous regression and considering the extension of affected skin tissue a second round of chemotherapy with prednisolone and vinblastine was administered for six weeks. There was a resolution of all the lesions following this second round, and the patient underwent maintenance therapy consisting of administrating mercaptopurine daily and prednisolone/vinblastine every three weeks during 12 months, staying in remission (Figure ).
Six months after the end of maintenance therapy the patient had a recurrence of the disease and started second-line chemotherapy with clofarabine and cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C). The patient did not comply with the treatment and the disease progressed. As a result of skin ulceration, she developed skin and soft tissue infection that evolved into septic shock and did not survive despite intensive care support.",potential adverse effects of vinblastine,Knows adverse effects of various drugs or recognizes signs and symptoms of drug (and drug-drug) interactions,"A 44-year-old female patient suffering from various conditions like asthma, hypertension, obesity, and depression, was diagnosed with persistent cutaneous candidiasis. Despite multiple treatments, her condition showed no signs of improvement. Following a skin biopsy, her treatment plan was altered to include prednisolone and vinblastine-based chemotherapy.

26,"A 70-year-old female with multiple medical comorbidities, including hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and multiple prosthetic joints including a left total knee arthroplasty (TKA), presented to the emergency room with one-week history of left knee pain, erythema, and swelling. Prior to developing the symptoms in her knee, she suffered from loose stools and abdominal pain that had resolved by the time the patient developed pain in her knee. The patient denied any recent trauma, any rashes, or recent travel.
Physical examination was pertinent for tachycardia with a heart rate of 147 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, temperature of 100.5 F, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. Blood pressure was 101/59 mmHg. The left knee was red, hot, and swollen. The range of motion of the left knee was restricted. The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable.
On laboratory work up, hemoglobin was 15.2 g/dL (13.5–17.5 g/dL); white blood cell (WBC) count, 14,900 cells/uL (4.5–11 k/uL), total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL (0.3–1.0 mg/dL); aspartate aminotransferase, 35 U/L (13–39 U/L); alanine aminotransferase, 33 U/L (4–33 U/L); alkaline phosphatase, 124 U/L (34–104 U/L); s. creatinine, 2.3 mg/dl; and sodium and potassium, within normal limits. Lateral and anterior-posterior view X-rays of the left knee joint showed prior total knee replacement but no other significant findings (Figures and ).
The initial differentials included septic arthritis of her prosthetic knee joint and reactive arthritis after her recent diarrhea. Gout and other rheumatologic conditions were less likely.
A preliminary diagnosis of sepsis due to septic arthritis was made, and supportive management with intravenous (IV) fluids, empiric antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn), and antipyretics was initiated. Arthrocentesis was performed, and purulent fluid was drained. This was sent for Gram staining and cultures. Gram staining was significant for numerous WBCs and Gram-negative coccobacilli. The culture came back the next day growing Gram-positive coccobacilli that were subsequently identified as Yersinia enterocolitis. This was sensitive to all the antibiotics it was tested against. The blood cultures came back positive for Yersinia enterocolitica too. Yersinia enterocolitica was identified as the cause of the septic arthritis, which was likely the cause of her diarrhea prior to presenting.
The patient was seen by orthopedic surgery in consultation and underwent resection of her left TKA and placement of a biodegradable implant without any complications. The patient was also seen by infectious disease in consultation, and based on their recommendations, the patient was discharged home to complete 6 weeks of outpatient IV antibiotics in the form of 2 g of ceftriaxone daily considering her sepsis and prosthetic material in her knee joint. The patient completed this without any complications.

27,"In November 2016, a Caucasian 75-year-old woman, a former smoker (7.5 pack-years), was hospitalized for breathlessness. Her past medical history included atrial fibrillation treated with warfarin, arterial hypertension treated with betaloxol, and gastroesophageal reflux. She ran a bar–tobacco shop with significant long-term exposure to passive smoking. She was not exposed to asbestos. Clinical examination on admission revealed good performance status, stage 1 modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea, crackles at lung bases, and no digital clubbing or extrathoracic signs. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed interstitial lung disease (ILD) with subpleural reticulations without evidence of honeycombing or enlarged lymph node (Fig. ). Standard biology, serological testing, bronchoscopy, and bronchoalveolar lavage were normal. Pulmonary function tests demonstrated bronchial obstruction [forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio, 0.66; FEV1, 97% of predicted values (% pred.)], preserved volumes [FVC, 121% pred.; total lung capacity (TLC), 111% pred.], and alteration of gas diffusion (TLCO, 62% pred.). ILD multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) reached a CT pattern of possible usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), which led to the proposal of performing surgical lung biopsy. Wedge resection of the right upper and lower lobes was performed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in July 2017. Both resected lung specimens showed a similar pattern of UIP: fibroblastic foci and honeycombing. In addition, the right lower lobe specimen displayed numerous disseminated foci of well-differentiated focally invasive SCC without invasion of visceral pleura (Fig. ). Complete resection was obtained without SCC-positive surgical margins. A PET–CT scan performed in September 2017 showed mild hypermetabolism of ILD [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), 3.5], without hypermetabolic lung nodule, mass, or enlarged lymph node. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal. There was no indication for adjuvant antineoplastic treatment based on pathological findings. After ILD MDD in October 2017, it was decided to introduce an antifibrotic treatment owing to pathological confirmation of UIP. Nintedanib was chosen as this molecule is also known for its antitumor properties. At the last follow-up in October 2019, that is, 2 years after initiation of nintedanib, clinical, functional (FVC, 130% pred.; TLCO, 61% pred.), and CT scan evaluations were stable (Fig. ).

28,"A 62-year-old man, affected dysphagia, was endoscopically diagnosed with lower esophageal cancer confirmed squamous cell carcinoma on biopsy, and was reffered to our hospital (Fig. ). He had no medical history. His lifestyle has included 1500 ml beer consumption per day and 40 cigarettes per day for the past 40 years. Computed tomography (CT) showed thickening of the wall in the lower esophagus as the primary lesion was demonstrated and the tumor formed a mass with the solitary metastatic abdominal lymph node, and invaded pancreas body and gastric body (Fig. ). No other distant metastasis was detected on CT. He was diagnosed with lower esophageal cancer cT4 N1 M0, with pancreatic invasion, cStage IIIC according to 7th edition of the Union for International Cancer Control system []. At first, we considered definitive chemoradiotherapy. However, radiation oncologists evaluated that the tumor was less candidate for chemoradiotherapy because of the risk of gastric mucosal damage. For the purpose of definitive therapy, radical esophagectomy with distal pancreatectomy was planned. As neoadjuvant chemotherapy, CF therapy (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil therapy; cisplatin was dripped 80 mg/m2 plus 5-fluorouracil was infused 800 mg/m2 on day 1 through 4 continuously) was started according to standard therapy of localized advanced esophageal cancer []. However, after once administration, he could not continue chemotherapy for the exacerbation of dysphagia, and underwent radical surgery. Preoperative evaluation of tumor was similar to initial findings on endoscopy and CT.
In findings on laparotomy, abdominal lymph node was infiltrated directly to pancreas body. As the radical surgery, Ivor Lewis esophagectomy with distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, followed by reconstruction of gastric conduit. Two fields lymphadenectomy was performed according to the treatment strategy of the abdominal esophageal cancer. Reconstruction of gastric conduit was possible although the lymph node was adherent to lesser side of gastric body, which was resected when reconstruction of gastric conduit. In addition, partial resection of lung was performed simultaneously owing to involvement of bilateral pulmonary ligaments to the primary tumor (Fig. ). The operative time was 528 min. The estimated blood loss was 2850 ml, and the patient was transfused 4 units of red blood cell concentrates.
The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was able to take orally. He was discharged 16 days after operation with tube-free. After discharge, he underwent two courses of CF therapy as adjuvant chemotherapy. At present, he is still alive and has no recurrence for 7 years after surgery.
In the resected specimen, the primary lesion was observed from lower esophagus to esophagogastric junction, and metastatic lymph node was fixed to stomach and pancreas body (Fig. ). Pathological examination revealed that primary lesion was not infiltrated to lung (Fig. a, b). Massive metastatic lymph node (over 5cm) was observed in the lesser curvature of stomach, and infiltrated to pancreas and gastric wall with extranodal extension (Fig. c, d). The tumor was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated type. The vascular and lymphatic invasion was confirmed. The surgical margin was negative. The pathological stage was ypT4 N1 (1/61) M0 (metastatic lymph node invasion into pancreas), ypStage IIIC. The histopathological response of chemotherapy was grade 1a, which was equivalent that proliferable cells were 2/3 or more, in 7th edition of the Union for International Cancer Control system [].","neoadjuvant chemotherapy (or chemoradiotherapy, based on the patient’s condition) + radical esophagectomy",most appropriate management of selected conditions,"A 62-year-old man with a history of heavy alcohol and tobacco use was diagnosed with lower esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

29,"The patient is a 68-year-old retired male, born in Aloag and resident of Tambillo (a rural locality in the vicinity of the capital of Ecuador, Quito). His medical history was significant only for being a heavy smoker until 2016 (with a calculated 20 pack-year), copious alcohol consumption every 15 days until 2010 and a myocardial infarction in 2015, successfully treated with stenting, acetylsalicylic acid and atorvastatin, a medication that he continues until this day. There is no family history of cancer or other pathologies of interest.
In February 2020, he presented dysesthesias in the right hemithorax associated with pain and a mass-like sensation in the same region. This prompted a visit to his local healthcare center (part of the public health network) where a chest CT scan was ordered in March 2020 revealing a solitary pulmonary mass located in the right inferior lobule with an invasion of both the pleura and thoracic wall. However, due to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ecuador, all further studies were suspended for two to three months, resulting in a significant delay of the biopsy, which was undertaken on May 17, 2020. The histopathological study reported a neuroendocrine carcinoma. The patient was subjected to a thoracotomy and inferior pulmonary lobectomy on June 7, 2020 and was afterward treated with four cycles of chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and etoposide until November of the same year. In December, the patient presents with neurologic symptoms consisting of loss of balance, ataxic gait, headaches, and nausea, prompting the necessity of a brain MRI. The study revealed a mass on the right lobe of the cerebellum (2.66 x 2.61 x 2.48cm) with perilesional edema, compressing the fourth ventricle. A progression of his primary lung cancer was diagnosed, the original chemotherapy regimen was suspended and replaced with adjuvant Temozolomide maintenance therapy, and he is referred to the radiotherapy service for WBRT with 20 Gy divided into five fractions, which improved his symptoms.
However, in March 2021, the patient comes to our hospital’s radiotherapy department to request a second opinion due to the reappearance of his neurological symptoms (loss of balance, headaches, nausea, dizziness, and photophobia). The physical examination is relevant for a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, oriented in time, place, and person, incapacitating ataxic gait (the patient needs to be mobilized in a wheelchair), and severe photophobia requiring the constant use of sunglasses. The rest of the neurological examination is normal including cranial nerves, reflexes, and somatosensory function. Relevant prognostic indexes were calculated and included the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) of 80%, and the Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA), specific for patients with brain metastasis, of 3. A CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis was obtained, on February 22, 2021, in order to detect any new tumoral or metastatic activity; however, none was found (Figures -). Therefore, a follow-up MRI was ordered on February 23, 2021, which revealed two intra-axial lesions on the right cerebellar hemisphere and near the right lateral ventricle, respectively (Figures -).
Due to the aforementioned clinical and imaging findings, radio-surgical management of the disease with 21Gy, in one fraction, delivered with a linear particle accelerator (LINAC), TrueBeam® (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was offered to the patient; immobilization was performed with a thermoplastic mask and Precise Bite mouthpiece (Solstice™ SRS Immobilization System, Orange City, IA); treatment simulation was done on the CT images and volume definition was performed in the contrasted T1 MRI with SPACE sequence; Gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined as the signal enhancing hyperintense tumoral regions observed on MRI and planning target volume (PTV) was prolonged 1mm in all directions. Dosimetric planning was based on HyperArc (Varian Medical System) which is a relatively new isocentric VMAT technique developed specifically for non-coplanar, multileaf collimator (MLC)-based stereotactic radiotherapy with automated treatment optimization and dose delivery; the clinical and dosimetric planning can be found in Figures -. Dosage and organ constraints, evaluation of the iso-dosage curve goals as well as the evaluation of the Paddick index were performed in accordance with published guidelines [,]. Before treatment, we administer a 16mg intramuscular deposit dexamethasone injection in order to reduce the risk of cerebellar tonsil herniation due to the important edema from the cerebellar metastasis. Tomographic images obtained with the Cone Beam CT system, integrated into the LINAC, showed a complete (100%) correlation of the images obtained during simulation and planning. Finally, the effective time of treatment was of four minutes.
Treatment was delayed as per the patient’s request for more time to consider and on April 5, 2021, the procedure was finally performed without complications and in an outpatient setting. A follow-up was programmed 15 days after treatment at which the patient presented significant clinical improvement (absence of headaches, nausea, dizziness, photophobia, and normal balance and gait). There was no evidence of radiation toxicity, and the cognitive function was normal. A control MRI on July 17, 2021, showed a clear reduction in the size of both lesions as well as complete resolution of the mass effect produced by the cerebellar mass; a comparison of the pre- and post-treatment scans can be found in Figures -.

She had reddish mucoid vagina. She had no clitoromegaly, acne, hirsutism, or palpable abdominal mass (Table ).
Left wrist X-ray revealed a bone age of 8 years.
The hormonal evaluation using fluorometric enzyme immunoassay showed basal luteinizing hormone of 3.1 mIU/L, which increased to 8.8 mIU/L 45 minutes post-gonadotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation. Elevated levels of estradiol E2 29,000 pg/ml (5–15 pg/ml), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate 90 ng/mL (2.3 ng/mL), with normal early morning cortisol level 16 ng/mL (7–28 ng/mL). Due to financial difficulties, we did not measured the follicular-stimulating hormone level.
Abdominal ultrasound revealed a right-sided hypoechoic suprarenal mass, an ovarian volume of 1.8 cm3, uterine volume of 3 cm3, and endometrial thickness of 1.2 cm. The abdominal CT scan showed a 25 × 22 mm well-defined rounded focal lesion with a smooth outline, at the level of the right adrenal gland with homogeneous attenuation, HU-7 on a noncontrast scan, and no evidence of local tissue invasion (Fig. ). The left adrenal gland and ovaries were normal.
Brain magnetic resonance imaging was done to exclude a central cause of precocious puberty and was normal. Complete hemogram, liver, and renal functions were normal.

31,"An 82-year-old male patient with angina on anticoagulant medication and without viral infection was referred to our department for the surgical treatment of HCC. His personal and family medical history was otherwise unremarkable. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a huge HCC mass in segment 4 and PVTT invasion from the nearby portal vein to the left portal trunk, main portal trunk, through to the contralateral right portal trunk. The tip of the PVTT progressed over to the bifurcation of the anterior and posterior branches of the portal trunk. The anterior branch was filled with PVTT, while the posterior branch was filled with PVTT or blood thrombus (Fig. ). No apparent intra- and extra-hepatic metastases were detected other than the main tumor. Laboratory data showed a serum albumin level of 3.8 g/dL, total bilirubin level of 0.5 mg/dL, platelet count of 13.9 × 104/uL, and a Child-Pugh score of 6. Serum levels of alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II were 90,770 ng/mL and 2847 mAU/mL, respectively. An antithrombotic drug was administered for the PVTT. Due to the overwhelming PVTT extensions, poor performance status, and old age, the patient was deemed not to have a surgical indication. Therefore, a combination treatment using atezolizumab plus bevacizumab with radiotherapy for PVTT was selected. During preparation for radiotherapy, one-time atezolizumab (1200 mg) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) were administered. He developed anal pain and persistent fever 9 days after administration, and CT showed perianal abscess due to anal fistula. Although he recovered soon after percutaneous abscess drainage, this adverse event interrupted atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment, and radiotherapy could not be introduced. Abdominal CT, conducted 3 weeks after the first administration, showed size reduction of the main tumor and PVTT, with a reduction in tumor enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT. Serum AFP decreased from 90,700 ng/mL before treatment to 18,371 ng/mL and 6301 ng/mL 3 and 5 weeks after atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment, respectively. Considering the excellent response to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment (one-time administration), we decided to continue with this treatment after creating colostomy. Colostomy was performed 47 days after the first administration of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Subsequently, beginning from the 83rd day after the first administration of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, atezolizumab monotherapy was initiated. The reason for choosing atezolizumab monotherapy was that the bleeding from the colostomy persists from the collateral blood circulation due to the liver cirrhosis. The serum AFP decreased to 89 ng/mL just before the next atezolizumab monotherapy, and abdominal CT showed continued partial response (Fig. ); serum AFP levels kept decreasing toward the normal range (Fig. ). He received a one-time atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment and continued with atezolizumab monotherapy afterward (9 regimens administered until now); there is no apparent sign of residual tumors at 9 months after the introduction of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment.",possible radiation injury,recognizes associated conditions of a disease,"An 82-year-old male patient with angina and on anticoagulant medication presented for the surgical treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). The patient had no viral infection, and his medical history was otherwise unremarkable. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a significant HCC mass in segment 4 and Portal Vein Tumor Thrombus (PVTT) invasion from the nearby portal vein to the left portal trunk, main portal trunk, and the contralateral right portal trunk. The patient's lab data showed elevated alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and a Child-Pugh score of 6, indicating liver disease. Due to extensive PVTT, poor performance status, and advanced age, the patient was not considered a candidate for surgery. Instead, a combination treatment using atezolizumab plus bevacizumab with radiotherapy for PVTT was chosen. However, he developed anal pain and persistent fever due to a perianal abscess caused by an anal fistula, interrupting the treatment. Despite this setback, the patient showed significant reduction in the size of the main tumor and PVTT, as well as a decrease in AFP levels after the first administration of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment. After creating a colostomy, atezolizumab monotherapy was initiated, and the patient showed continued partial response, with AFP levels decreasing to the normal range. The patient is currently showing no apparent signs of residual tumors 9 months after the introduction of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment.

32,"A 57-year-old man with NASH without cirrhosis presented to a satellite hospital with acute onset of painless hematochezia for 1 day. He had unprovoked deep venous thrombosis with a negative hypercoagulable workup and portal-vein thrombosis on Apixaban diagnosed 18 months prior to presentation. He was tachycardic and mildly hypotensive. There was no evidence of chronic liver disease on exam. The hemoglobin level was 130 g/L and subsequently decreased to 80 g/L, while the platelet count was 160 × 109/L. Laboratory tests revealed the following values: INR, 1.13; lactate, 1 mmol/L; albumin, 3.7 g/dl; and liver enzymes were within normal limits. Anticoagulation was discontinued and he was resuscitated using intravenous (IV) crystalloids. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed small non-bleeding esophageal varices. Colonoscopy revealed a complex ascending colonic varix with active bleeding ().
He was treated with IV octreotide at the satellite hospital at which he presented and then transferred to our tertiary institution for escalation of care. Liver-protocol computed tomography (CT) was performed for TIPS evaluation and revealed a steatotic liver and collateralized chronically thrombosed SMV with patent portal vein. He was deemed not to be a candidate for either TIPS or BRTO in the setting of chronic SMV thrombosis. Colonic resection was not recommended, since it was unlikely to prevent future bleeding with significant collaterals.
He continued to have hematochezia with Hgb nadir of 78 g/L. A trans-hepatic portogram performed by interventional radiology revealed an elevated absolute portal pressure of 18 mmHg. Digital subtraction images confirmed the site of the SMV occlusion at the confluence of two large SMV branches, in addition to retrograde flow through the large right CV. The occluded SMV was cannulated through a left patent branch using a 4-French angled glide catheter and a stiff Glidewire. A Cobra 2 catheter and a stiff Glidewire were used to cannulate the right SMV branch at the confluence. Recanalization of the occluded SMV () was achieved by using 5 × 40 mm balloon angioplasty to 5 mm, then two overlapping 10 × 40 mm self-expanding stents were successfully deployed into the origin of the right SMV branch, extending proximally into the portal splenic confluence. The stents were then post-dilated using balloon angioplasty to 8 and 10 mm. Follow-up venography showed antegrade flow in the right SMV branch into the SMV stent with a marked reduction in filling of the right CV (). The procedure was terminated after restoration of the SMV flow and the portal pressure was not measured post-procedurally. Liver biopsy showed steatohepatitis with stage 2/4 fibrosis. Apixaban and low-dose aspirin were started. Two months after discharge, the patient had no recurrent bleeding and CT showed patent SMV stents ().

34,"A two-year-old female, previously healthy and normally developing, presented with a six-week history of macrocephaly and truncal and peripheral ataxia. An eye examination showed a lack of papilledema but was suspicious for mild peripheral loss of vision. Her past medical history was unremarkable. She did not have diencephalic syndrome at presentation. An urgent brain MRI demonstrated the presence of a large lobulated multicompartmental supra-sellar mass centered within the hypothalamus/optic chiasm (5.4cm x 3.4cm x 5cm) (Figure ), with extension into the surrounding structures and mass effect on the midbrain and third ventricle causing obstructive hydrocephalus. She initially underwent an endoscopic biopsy and septostomy, along with a right-sided ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt to manage her hydrocephalus. The pathology of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of a low-grade glioma (LGG) that was BRAF-V600E negative on immunohistochemistry but positive on next-generation sequencing (Figure ). She was started on chemotherapy with vincristine and carboplatin, but unfortunately she had rapid tumor progression with worsening hydrocephalus six weeks into chemotherapy. This progression caused the patient to develop further complications, including progressive right-sided hemiparesis, bitemporal hemianopia, central hypothyroidism, and feeding difficulties requiring a gastrostomy tube and placement of a second VP shunt. After extensive discussions and mutual expert consensus, her chemotherapy was stopped, and she was started on the novel targeted agent dabrafenib (5.25mg/kg/day). By three months of starting dabrafenib, the size of her tumor decreased by more than 70% (2.5cm x 3.5cm x 2.7cm), with continued decline until plateauing after two years of therapy (Figure ). Prior to dabrafenib, the patient had marked motor and speech impairments but is now able to perform all age-appropriate developmental skills independently. She no longer requires tube feeding and has been growing well. Her bitemporal hemianopia has improved markedly. Her visual acuity is the only symptom that has not shown significant recovery, as she continues to have low but stable visual acuity bilaterally. Our patient is currently five years old, has been on dabrafenib for 30 months, and, to date, she has not experienced any side effects while on targeted therapy. Our plan is to continue on dabrafenib as long as the patient is tolerating the therapy well with no recurrence or progression of the tumor.
Consent was obtained from the parents for sharing of the clinical information and participation in the ORCYD (Oncology Repository for Children and Young Adults) biomarker study.

He had a history of having undergone open suprapubic cystostomy (SPC) 8 years ago for acute urinary retention secondary to recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI). He developed surgical site infection (SSI) postoperatively which was managed conservatively. The stricture had been managed with internal optic urethrotomy (IOU) and serial dilatations, following which the patient started doing well with 6 monthly dilatations.
Since last 2 years, he developed a swelling in the right inguinoscrotal region associated with repeated thinning of urinary stream and recurrent episodes of burning micturition. The swelling became static and persistent in the last 2 months.
On examination, there was a 5-cm long vertical midline scar in the suprapubic region. An irreducible soft swelling of 8 cm × 6 cm was present in the right inguinal region which extended up to the base of scrotum. Cough impulse was present, and we could not get above the swelling. The defect could not be localized. There was also a gradual growing difficulty in negotiating urethral dilators due to the path distortion by the contents of the hernia. Cystoscopy revealed narrowing in bulbar urethra with deviations in the proximal anterior urethra and the scope needed to be negotiated to reach the urinary bladder. Ultrasound showed findings consistent with right inguinal omentocele and a scarred suprapubic region. Defect could not be localized.

The anterior branch was filled with PVTT, while the posterior branch was filled with PVTT or blood thrombus (Fig. ). No apparent intra- and extra-hepatic metastases were detected other than the main tumor. Laboratory data showed a serum albumin level of 3.8 g/dL, total bilirubin level of 0.5 mg/dL, platelet count of 13.9 × 104/uL, and a Child-Pugh score of 6. Serum levels of alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II were 90,770 ng/mL and 2847 mAU/mL, respectively. An antithrombotic drug was administered for the PVTT. Due to the overwhelming PVTT extensions, poor performance status, and old age, the patient was deemed not to have a surgical indication.

44,"On July 2008, a 59-year-old man, ex-smoker (45 packs/year), underwent upper right lung lobectomy and regional lymph adenectomy with the diagnosis of stage I (pT2, pN0) lung adenocarcinoma, solid pattern. On July 2020, the chest CT scan revealed the presence of an upper left lung lobe and two lower left lung lobe lesions. On August 2020, the patient underwent a wedge resection of the upper and the lower lung lobes lesions with N1 and N2 nodal sampling.
Gross examination of the surgical specimens of the first atypical pulmonary resection of left inferior lobe revealed an Intraparenchymal, peripheral, solid, yellow-white lesion measuring 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. Histological assessment identified a well-circumscribed lesion composed of two different morphological components, tightly adhered but not intermingled each other. The first component represented about 60% of the whole neoplasm and was characterized by a solid and trabecular proliferation of polygonal-shaped uniform tumor cells, with nuclei with finely granular chromatin and inconspicuocus nucleoli, consistent with carcinoid. Four mitosis/2 mm2 were identified, without tumoral necrosis. The second component, which represented about 40% of whole neoplasm, showed a main lepidic, non-mucinous pattern with secondary papillary architecture, corresponding to a lepidic-papillary pattern PA. Immunoreactivity for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, TTF-1, and pan-cytokeratins AE1–3 was documented in carcinoid component, while adenocarcinomatous component was positive only for TTF-1 and cytokeratins (). CK7 immunoreactivity was selectively documented in the adenocarcinomatous component. A final diagnosis of “combined pulmonary adenocarcinoma with atypical carcinoid” was made. No immunoreactivity for ALK and ROS1 was documented in both components. TPS for PD-L1 was <1% in both components. Both two other lesions on atypical pulmonary resections of the upper left lobe and inferior left lobe showed intraparenchymal neoplasm of 1.8 and 1.5 cm, respectively, corresponding both to PA with a main solid pattern and lepidic, non-mucinous second pattern. A positivity ROS1 score of 2+ with gene rearrangement on FISH was documented in the upper pulmonary lobe neoplasia. No immunoreactivity for ALK and a PD-L1 TPS of 1%–49% were observed. No immunoreactivity for ALK and ROS1 with PD-L1 TPS of >50% were documented in the lower lobe neoplasia. No pleural invasion was observed. No lymph nodes metastases were found. The final UICC 2017 stage pT4 (m-3) (PL0) pN0 was assigned.
Targeted NGS analysis on Ion Torrent NGS platform using the Ocav3 panel was performed on DNA and RNA extracted from each microdissected histological components of the primary mixed neoplasm (I1/I2) and in the other two adenocarcinomas located in the inferior (I3) and superior (S1) left pulmonary lobes. Summary of genetic results are shown in 
. Among a total of 161 investigated genes included in the NGS panel, both common and private somatic genes mutations were identified in each entity (). The adenocarcinoma I1 and carcinoid I2 components of the mixed neoplasm shared the same mutations in BRAF (p.Gly466Ala), NF1 (p.Pro1359LeufsTer19 and p.Glu1928Ter), STK11 (p.Gly188AlafsTer99), and AKT2 (p.Leu52Ter) genes. Four additional somatic mutations were detected in the DDR2 (p.Arg806Ter), CDK6 (p.Thr107Ser), and SMARCA4 gene (p.Arg1135Gln) were identified in the adenocarcinoma component, whereas no specific mutations were identified in the carcinoid component. A different genetic profile emerged from the molecular analysis of the two additional adenocarcinoma nodules I3 and S1, lacking those somatic mutations identified in the mixed nodules, but shared two somatic missense mutations in the KRAS (p.Gly12Asp) and NOTCH1 (p.Pro498Arg). In addition, the I3 adenocarcinoma showed a specific, somatic mutations in ATM (p.Gln1117Ter), TP53 (p.Gly245Asp), and CDK12 (p.Arg44Trp) genes, whereas the S1 adenocarcinoma showed a specific, somatic, missense mutations in IDH2 gene (p.Arg172Ser).

Physical examination was pertinent for tachycardia with a heart rate of 147 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, temperature of 100.5 F, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. Blood pressure was 101/59 mmHg. The left knee was red, hot, and swollen. The range of motion of the left knee was restricted. The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable.
On laboratory work up, hemoglobin was 15.2 g/dL (13.5–17.5 g/dL); white blood cell (WBC) count, 14,900 cells/uL (4.5–11 k/uL), total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL (0.3–1.0 mg/dL); aspartate aminotransferase, 35 U/L (13–39 U/L); alanine aminotransferase, 33 U/L (4–33 U/L); alkaline phosphatase, 124 U/L (34–104 U/L); s. creatinine, 2.3 mg/dl; and sodium and potassium, within normal limits. Lateral and anterior-posterior view X-rays of the left knee joint showed prior total knee replacement but no other significant findings (Figures and ).
The initial differentials included septic arthritis of her prosthetic knee joint and reactive arthritis after her recent diarrhea. Gout and other rheumatologic conditions were less likely.
A preliminary diagnosis of sepsis due to septic arthritis was made, and supportive management with intravenous (IV) fluids, empiric antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn), and antipyretics was initiated. Arthrocentesis was performed, and purulent fluid was drained. This was sent for Gram staining and cultures. Gram staining was significant for numerous WBCs and Gram-negative coccobacilli. The culture came back the next day growing Gram-positive coccobacilli that were subsequently identified as Yersinia enterocolitis. This was sensitive to all the antibiotics it was tested against. The blood cultures came back positive for Yersinia enterocolitica too. Yersinia enterocolitica was identified as the cause of the septic arthritis, which was likely the cause of her diarrhea prior to presenting.
The patient was seen by orthopedic surgery in consultation and underwent resection of her left TKA and placement of a biodegradable implant without any complications. The patient was also seen by infectious disease in consultation, and based on their recommendations, the patient was discharged home to complete 6 weeks of outpatient IV antibiotics in the form of 2 g of ceftriaxone daily considering her sepsis and prosthetic material in her knee joint.

50,"In November 2016, a Caucasian 75-year-old woman, a former smoker (7.5 pack-years), was hospitalized for breathlessness. Her past medical history included atrial fibrillation treated with warfarin, arterial hypertension treated with betaloxol, and gastroesophageal reflux. She ran a bar–tobacco shop with significant long-term exposure to passive smoking. She was not exposed to asbestos. Clinical examination on admission revealed good performance status, stage 1 modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea, crackles at lung bases, and no digital clubbing or extrathoracic signs. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed interstitial lung disease (ILD) with subpleural reticulations without evidence of honeycombing or enlarged lymph node (Fig. ). Standard biology, serological testing, bronchoscopy, and bronchoalveolar lavage were normal. Pulmonary function tests demonstrated bronchial obstruction [forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio, 0.66; FEV1, 97% of predicted values (% pred.)], preserved volumes [FVC, 121% pred.; total lung capacity (TLC), 111% pred.], and alteration of gas diffusion (TLCO, 62% pred.). ILD multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) reached a CT pattern of possible usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), which led to the proposal of performing surgical lung biopsy. Wedge resection of the right upper and lower lobes was performed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in July 2017. Both resected lung specimens showed a similar pattern of UIP: fibroblastic foci and honeycombing. In addition, the right lower lobe specimen displayed numerous disseminated foci of well-differentiated focally invasive SCC without invasion of visceral pleura (Fig. ). Complete resection was obtained without SCC-positive surgical margins. A PET–CT scan performed in September 2017 showed mild hypermetabolism of ILD [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), 3.5], without hypermetabolic lung nodule, mass, or enlarged lymph node. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal. There was no indication for adjuvant antineoplastic treatment based on pathological findings. After ILD MDD in October 2017, it was decided to introduce an antifibrotic treatment owing to pathological confirmation of UIP. Nintedanib was chosen as this molecule is also known for its antitumor properties. At the last follow-up in October 2019, that is, 2 years after initiation of nintedanib, clinical, functional (FVC, 130% pred.; TLCO, 61% pred.), and CT scan evaluations were stable (Fig. ).

51,"A 14-year-old male adolescent presented to the emergency department with subfebrile temperatures for 1 week and localized pain in his right popliteal fossa for 3 days. Prior to the onset of these symptoms, he had been immobilized for several days following a minor sports injury.
The adolescent had no permanent medication and no prior medical history except for an asymptomatic ATD diagnosed at the age of six by functional antithrombin assay (antithrombin activity of 57%, age adapted reference: 77–125%). Since at that time, there were no clinical signs of thrombosis, the diagnosis of ATD did not lead to any therapeutic consequences. Screening for ATD at this early age had been carried out on parental request, as his mother was diagnosed with ATD in her early adulthood. Interestingly, his mother now reported that she had very recently been diagnosed with IVCA (preexisting chromogenic test results showed an antithrombin activity of 50% for the mother, the age adjusted reference range being 80 to 130%).
The coexistence of other hereditary thrombophilic disorders in our patient and his mother (protein S deficiency, protein C deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin-mutation, antiphospholipid syndrome) was ruled out by respective laboratory analyses.
Laboratory blood analysis in the emergency department showed markedly elevated D-dimers of 25 mg/l FEU (reference: < 0.5 mg/l FEU) and of C-reactive protein (CrP) of 184 mg/l (reference < 5 mg/l). Antithrombin activity on admission was reduced to 61% (age adjusted reference 83–118%).
A vascular ultrasound examination upon admission confirmed the clinically suspected thrombosis of the right lower extremity involving the external iliac, common and superficial femoral as well as the popliteal vein. The ultrasound examination of the left lower extremity veins did not give evidence of thromboses upon admission. The patient was treated with continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin at a therapeutical dose including several bolus administrations and antithrombin (4000 IE within the first 36 h) was substituted reaching levels in the target range between 80 and 100%. Subsequent monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) showed an insufficient response to heparin treatment (aPTT was 29 s before the administration of heparin and did not exceed a maximum value of 33.6 s during heparin treatment). The anticoagulative therapy was therefore switched to direct thrombin inhibition by argatroban at a dose of 1.5–2.0 μg/kg/min, which led to target aPTT values of 50–60s.
Due to the elevated CrP levels and subfebrile temperatures, empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous cefuroxim was initiated.
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan on day three confirmed a complete DVT of the right lower extremity, and now additionally extended thromboses of the left lower extremity and thrombosis of both iliac vessels. Furthermore, it revealed an occlusion of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with prominent venous lumbar collaterals, suggestive of IVCA. Surrounding the lumbar vertebrae, several of these collaterals appeared to be fully thrombotic, which was confirmed by angiography (Fig. A).
The following day, a catheter-directed local thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) at a daily dose of 0.25 mg/kg was initiated in both extremities and carried out for a total of 48 h. For the right leg, an additional ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis using the EKOS® system was performed.
During hospitalization, the anticoagulative therapy was switched from argatroban to the vitamin K antagonist phenprocoumon with a target International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.0–2.5. Oral anticoagulation will most likely be continued lifelong due to the combination of extended multilocal thromboses with underlying ATD, as well as IVCA, which in itself is a risk factor for thrombosis.
The patient was discharged on day eight after hospital admission. An ultrasound examination upon discharge showed full recanalization of the femoral and iliac veins of both legs.
During a routine follow-up 1 week later, the patient presented free of any clinical complaints. However, despite continued oral anticoagulation since hospital discharge, vascular ultrasound now revealed extended re-thrombosis of both the right and left pelvic axis and the right lower extremity, thus leading to a second hospital admission and re-induction of therapy with both intravenous antithrombin and catheter-directed thrombolysis.
Recanalization of the right lower extremity and pelvic axis was subsequently achieved, whereby IVC occlusion was confirmed (Fig. B). However, the left pelvic vessels remained thrombotic even after 5 days of catheter-directed thrombolysis.
Surprisingly, one of the angiographies allowed for location of the occluded area of the IVC by rendezvous-technique between the superior and inferior vena cava, which prior to this had been thought to be atretic (Fig. C). The vessel was successfully recanalized using balloon dilation and subsequent stenting (Fig. D).
Throughout the clinical stay, the patient’s oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon was intensified to a new target INR of 2.5–3.0 in order to prevent re-thrombosis.
The patient was discharged from hospital on day seven after admission. Regular follow-up examinations at our outpatient clinic did not give evidence for any new thrombotic events to date (time since first occurrence of thrombosis was 9 months).

Despite treatment with unfractionated heparin and antithrombin, the patient showed an inadequate response. On switching to argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, the patient's condition improved, but he developed further thromboses requiring catheter-directed local thrombolysis and a switch to phenprocoumon for long-term management.In the context of this patient's antithrombin deficiency and inadequate response to heparin treatment, which medication proved to be the most effective initial intervention for his lower extremity thrombosis?","{'A': 'unfractionated heparin', 'B': 'argatroban', 'C': 'dabigatran', 'D': 'warfarin', 'E': 'phenprocoumon', 'F': 'aspirin'}",argatroban,B
53,"A 14-year-old male adolescent presented to the emergency department with subfebrile temperatures for 1 week and localized pain in his right popliteal fossa for 3 days. Prior to the onset of these symptoms, he had been immobilized for several days following a minor sports injury.
The adolescent had no permanent medication and no prior medical history except for an asymptomatic ATD diagnosed at the age of six by functional antithrombin assay (antithrombin activity of 57%, age adapted reference: 77–125%). Since at that time, there were no clinical signs of thrombosis, the diagnosis of ATD did not lead to any therapeutic consequences. Screening for ATD at this early age had been carried out on parental request, as his mother was diagnosed with ATD in her early adulthood. Interestingly, his mother now reported that she had very recently been diagnosed with IVCA (preexisting chromogenic test results showed an antithrombin activity of 50% for the mother, the age adjusted reference range being 80 to 130%).
The coexistence of other hereditary thrombophilic disorders in our patient and his mother (protein S deficiency, protein C deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin-mutation, antiphospholipid syndrome) was ruled out by respective laboratory analyses.
Laboratory blood analysis in the emergency department showed markedly elevated D-dimers of 25 mg/l FEU (reference: < 0.5 mg/l FEU) and of C-reactive protein (CrP) of 184 mg/l (reference < 5 mg/l). Antithrombin activity on admission was reduced to 61% (age adjusted reference 83–118%).
A vascular ultrasound examination upon admission confirmed the clinically suspected thrombosis of the right lower extremity involving the external iliac, common and superficial femoral as well as the popliteal vein. The ultrasound examination of the left lower extremity veins did not give evidence of thromboses upon admission. The patient was treated with continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin at a therapeutical dose including several bolus administrations and antithrombin (4000 IE within the first 36 h) was substituted reaching levels in the target range between 80 and 100%. Subsequent monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) showed an insufficient response to heparin treatment (aPTT was 29 s before the administration of heparin and did not exceed a maximum value of 33.6 s during heparin treatment). The anticoagulative therapy was therefore switched to direct thrombin inhibition by argatroban at a dose of 1.5–2.0 μg/kg/min, which led to target aPTT values of 50–60s.
Due to the elevated CrP levels and subfebrile temperatures, empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous cefuroxim was initiated.
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan on day three confirmed a complete DVT of the right lower extremity, and now additionally extended thromboses of the left lower extremity and thrombosis of both iliac vessels. Furthermore, it revealed an occlusion of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with prominent venous lumbar collaterals, suggestive of IVCA. Surrounding the lumbar vertebrae, several of these collaterals appeared to be fully thrombotic, which was confirmed by angiography (Fig. A).
The following day, a catheter-directed local thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) at a daily dose of 0.25 mg/kg was initiated in both extremities and carried out for a total of 48 h. For the right leg, an additional ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis using the EKOS® system was performed.
During hospitalization, the anticoagulative therapy was switched from argatroban to the vitamin K antagonist phenprocoumon with a target International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.0–2.5. Oral anticoagulation will most likely be continued lifelong due to the combination of extended multilocal thromboses with underlying ATD, as well as IVCA, which in itself is a risk factor for thrombosis.
The patient was discharged on day eight after hospital admission. An ultrasound examination upon discharge showed full recanalization of the femoral and iliac veins of both legs.
During a routine follow-up 1 week later, the patient presented free of any clinical complaints. However, despite continued oral anticoagulation since hospital discharge, vascular ultrasound now revealed extended re-thrombosis of both the right and left pelvic axis and the right lower extremity, thus leading to a second hospital admission and re-induction of therapy with both intravenous antithrombin and catheter-directed thrombolysis.
Recanalization of the right lower extremity and pelvic axis was subsequently achieved, whereby IVC occlusion was confirmed (Fig. B). However, the left pelvic vessels remained thrombotic even after 5 days of catheter-directed thrombolysis.
Surprisingly, one of the angiographies allowed for location of the occluded area of the IVC by rendezvous-technique between the superior and inferior vena cava, which prior to this had been thought to be atretic (Fig. C). The vessel was successfully recanalized using balloon dilation and subsequent stenting (Fig. D).
Throughout the clinical stay, the patient’s oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon was intensified to a new target INR of 2.5–3.0 in order to prevent re-thrombosis.
The patient was discharged from hospital on day seven after admission. Regular follow-up examinations at our outpatient clinic did not give evidence for any new thrombotic events to date (time since first occurrence of thrombosis was 9 months).
Concerning the thrombotic left iliac vessels, a follow-up angiographic intervention relying on special equipment was performed, but recanalization could not be achieved.
Fortunately, the IVC of the patient’s mother could also be recanalized by angiographic intervention.",vascular ultrasound,follow-up or monitoring approach regarding the management plan,"A 14-year-old male came to the emergency department with a week-long subfebrile temperature and right popliteal fossa pain for 3 days.

Blood tests showed elevated D-dimers and C-reactive protein (CrP), indicating inflammation and potential blood clots. Vascular ultrasound confirmed thrombosis in the right lower extremity. Despite treatment, the patient's response was insufficient, leading to further thromboses detected by MRI scan. Even after re-induction of therapy, the left pelvic vessels remained thrombotic.

54,"The patient is a 68-year-old retired male, born in Aloag and resident of Tambillo (a rural locality in the vicinity of the capital of Ecuador, Quito). His medical history was significant only for being a heavy smoker until 2016 (with a calculated 20 pack-year), copious alcohol consumption every 15 days until 2010 and a myocardial infarction in 2015, successfully treated with stenting, acetylsalicylic acid and atorvastatin, a medication that he continues until this day. There is no family history of cancer or other pathologies of interest.
In February 2020, he presented dysesthesias in the right hemithorax associated with pain and a mass-like sensation in the same region. This prompted a visit to his local healthcare center (part of the public health network) where a chest CT scan was ordered in March 2020 revealing a solitary pulmonary mass located in the right inferior lobule with an invasion of both the pleura and thoracic wall. However, due to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ecuador, all further studies were suspended for two to three months, resulting in a significant delay of the biopsy, which was undertaken on May 17, 2020. The histopathological study reported a neuroendocrine carcinoma. The patient was subjected to a thoracotomy and inferior pulmonary lobectomy on June 7, 2020 and was afterward treated with four cycles of chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and etoposide until November of the same year. In December, the patient presents with neurologic symptoms consisting of loss of balance, ataxic gait, headaches, and nausea, prompting the necessity of a brain MRI. The study revealed a mass on the right lobe of the cerebellum (2.66 x 2.61 x 2.48cm) with perilesional edema, compressing the fourth ventricle. A progression of his primary lung cancer was diagnosed, the original chemotherapy regimen was suspended and replaced with adjuvant Temozolomide maintenance therapy, and he is referred to the radiotherapy service for WBRT with 20 Gy divided into five fractions, which improved his symptoms.
However, in March 2021, the patient comes to our hospital’s radiotherapy department to request a second opinion due to the reappearance of his neurological symptoms (loss of balance, headaches, nausea, dizziness, and photophobia). The physical examination is relevant for a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, oriented in time, place, and person, incapacitating ataxic gait (the patient needs to be mobilized in a wheelchair), and severe photophobia requiring the constant use of sunglasses. The rest of the neurological examination is normal including cranial nerves, reflexes, and somatosensory function. Relevant prognostic indexes were calculated and included the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) of 80%, and the Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA), specific for patients with brain metastasis, of 3. A CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis was obtained, on February 22, 2021, in order to detect any new tumoral or metastatic activity; however, none was found (Figures -). Therefore, a follow-up MRI was ordered on February 23, 2021, which revealed two intra-axial lesions on the right cerebellar hemisphere and near the right lateral ventricle, respectively (Figures -).
Due to the aforementioned clinical and imaging findings, radio-surgical management of the disease with 21Gy, in one fraction, delivered with a linear particle accelerator (LINAC), TrueBeam® (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was offered to the patient; immobilization was performed with a thermoplastic mask and Precise Bite mouthpiece (Solstice™ SRS Immobilization System, Orange City, IA); treatment simulation was done on the CT images and volume definition was performed in the contrasted T1 MRI with SPACE sequence; Gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined as the signal enhancing hyperintense tumoral regions observed on MRI and planning target volume (PTV) was prolonged 1mm in all directions. Dosimetric planning was based on HyperArc (Varian Medical System) which is a relatively new isocentric VMAT technique developed specifically for non-coplanar, multileaf collimator (MLC)-based stereotactic radiotherapy with automated treatment optimization and dose delivery; the clinical and dosimetric planning can be found in Figures -. Dosage and organ constraints, evaluation of the iso-dosage curve goals as well as the evaluation of the Paddick index were performed in accordance with published guidelines [,]. Before treatment, we administer a 16mg intramuscular deposit dexamethasone injection in order to reduce the risk of cerebellar tonsil herniation due to the important edema from the cerebellar metastasis. Tomographic images obtained with the Cone Beam CT system, integrated into the LINAC, showed a complete (100%) correlation of the images obtained during simulation and planning. Finally, the effective time of treatment was of four minutes.
Treatment was delayed as per the patient’s request for more time to consider and on April 5, 2021, the procedure was finally performed without complications and in an outpatient setting. A follow-up was programmed 15 days after treatment at which the patient presented significant clinical improvement (absence of headaches, nausea, dizziness, photophobia, and normal balance and gait).

His medical history was significant only for being a heavy smoker until 2016 (with a calculated 20 pack-year), copious alcohol consumption every 15 days until 2010 and a myocardial infarction in 2015, successfully treated with stenting, acetylsalicylic acid and atorvastatin, a medication that he continues until this day. There is no family history of cancer or other pathologies of interest.
In February 2020, he presented dysesthesias in the right hemithorax associated with pain and a mass-like sensation in the same region. This prompted a visit to his local healthcare center (part of the public health network) where a chest CT scan was ordered in March 2020 revealing a solitary pulmonary mass located in the right inferior lobule with an invasion of both the pleura and thoracic wall. However, due to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ecuador, all further studies were suspended for two to three months, resulting in a significant delay of the biopsy, which was undertaken on May 17, 2020. The histopathological study reported a neuroendocrine carcinoma. The patient was subjected to a thoracotomy and inferior pulmonary lobectomy on June 7, 2020 and was afterward treated with four cycles of chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and etoposide until November of the same year. In December, the patient presents with neurologic symptoms consisting of loss of balance, ataxic gait, headaches, and nausea, prompting the necessity of a brain MRI. The study revealed a mass on the right lobe of the cerebellum (2.66 x 2.61 x 2.48cm) with perilesional edema, compressing the fourth ventricle. A progression of his primary lung cancer was diagnosed, the original chemotherapy regimen was suspended and replaced with adjuvant Temozolomide maintenance therapy, and he is referred to the radiotherapy service for WBRT with 20 Gy divided into five fractions, which improved his symptoms.
However, in March 2021, the patient comes to our hospital’s radiotherapy department to request a second opinion due to the reappearance of his neurological symptoms (loss of balance, headaches, nausea, dizziness, and photophobia). The physical examination is relevant for a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, oriented in time, place, and person, incapacitating ataxic gait (the patient needs to be mobilized in a wheelchair), and severe photophobia requiring the constant use of sunglasses. The rest of the neurological examination is normal including cranial nerves, reflexes, and somatosensory function. Relevant prognostic indexes were calculated and included the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) of 80%, and the Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA), specific for patients with brain metastasis, of 3. A CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis was obtained, on February 22, 2021, in order to detect any new tumoral or metastatic activity; however, none was found (Figures -). Therefore, a follow-up MRI was ordered on February 23, 2021, which revealed two intra-axial lesions on the right cerebellar hemisphere and near the right lateral ventricle, respectively (Figures -).
Due to the aforementioned clinical and imaging findings, radio-surgical management of the disease with 21Gy, in one fraction, delivered with a linear particle accelerator (LINAC), TrueBeam® (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was offered to the patient; immobilization was performed with a thermoplastic mask and Precise Bite mouthpiece (Solstice™ SRS Immobilization System, Orange City, IA); treatment simulation was done on the CT images and volume definition was performed in the contrasted T1 MRI with SPACE sequence; Gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined as the signal enhancing hyperintense tumoral regions observed on MRI and planning target volume (PTV) was prolonged 1mm in all directions. Dosimetric planning was based on HyperArc (Varian Medical System) which is a relatively new isocentric VMAT technique developed specifically for non-coplanar, multileaf collimator (MLC)-based stereotactic radiotherapy with automated treatment optimization and dose delivery; the clinical and dosimetric planning can be found in Figures -. Dosage and organ constraints, evaluation of the iso-dosage curve goals as well as the evaluation of the Paddick index were performed in accordance with published guidelines [,]. Before treatment, we administer a 16mg intramuscular deposit dexamethasone injection in order to reduce the risk of cerebellar tonsil herniation due to the important edema from the cerebellar metastasis. Tomographic images obtained with the Cone Beam CT system, integrated into the LINAC, showed a complete (100%) correlation of the images obtained during simulation and planning. Finally, the effective time of treatment was of four minutes.
Treatment was delayed as per the patient’s request for more time to consider and on April 5, 2021, the procedure was finally performed without complications and in an outpatient setting. A follow-up was programmed 15 days after treatment at which the patient presented significant clinical improvement (absence of headaches, nausea, dizziness, photophobia, and normal balance and gait). There was no evidence of radiation toxicity, and the cognitive function was normal. A control MRI on July 17, 2021, showed a clear reduction in the size of both lesions as well as complete resolution of the mass effect produced by the cerebellar mass; a comparison of the pre- and post-treatment scans can be found in Figures -.

As the radical surgery, Ivor Lewis esophagectomy with distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, followed by reconstruction of gastric conduit. Two fields lymphadenectomy was performed according to the treatment strategy of the abdominal esophageal cancer. Reconstruction of gastric conduit was possible although the lymph node was adherent to lesser side of gastric body, which was resected when reconstruction of gastric conduit. In addition, partial resection of lung was performed simultaneously owing to involvement of bilateral pulmonary ligaments to the primary tumor (Fig. ). The operative time was 528 min. The estimated blood loss was 2850 ml, and the patient was transfused 4 units of red blood cell concentrates.
The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was able to take orally. He was discharged 16 days after operation with tube-free. After discharge, he underwent two courses of CF therapy as adjuvant chemotherapy. At present, he is still alive and has no recurrence for 7 years after surgery.
In the resected specimen, the primary lesion was observed from lower esophagus to esophagogastric junction, and metastatic lymph node was fixed to stomach and pancreas body (Fig. ). Pathological examination revealed that primary lesion was not infiltrated to lung (Fig. a, b). Massive metastatic lymph node (over 5cm) was observed in the lesser curvature of stomach, and infiltrated to pancreas and gastric wall with extranodal extension (Fig. c, d). The tumor was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated type. The vascular and lymphatic invasion was confirmed. The surgical margin was negative.

90,"A 68-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital on December 2, 2020, due to being “anxious and easily frightened for 3 months, psychomotor retardation, and affected by urinary incontinence for half a month.” The patient had no mental illness before and developed symptoms 3 months before admission. These included waking up early, being nervous and afraid for no apparent reason, and being fearful of leaving the house. The patient was upset, sensitive, and cried occasionally. In addition, the patient needed walking support (e.g., hands on the wall) at home to prevent falling. The patient had been hospitalized at a local mental health center 2 months prior to the present admission, where she was diagnosed with “GAD.” She received paroxetine (20 mg/d), tandospirone (30 mg/d), and oxazepam (15 mg/d). Her symptoms improved, and so she was discharged. She reported that she took the medications regularly according to the instructions. However, half a month prior to admission at our hospital, the patient experienced a relapse characterized by anxiety, fear, small steps while walking, reluctance to come out of her home, speaking less, and being slow to respond, as well as urinary incontinence. In addition, her social skills declined significantly, and the patient could not take care of herself independently. The patient had been diagnosed with type-II diabetes 4 years previously. No other comorbidities were reported. The patient had no abnormalities in her personal history, menstrual history, marriage and childbirth history, or family history.
Physical examination after admission revealed she had normal limb muscle strength and tone. The finger-to-nose, rapid alternating movement, heel-to-shin tests, and Romberg’s sign were normal. However, her gait was not stable and she took small steps. She was negative for pathological signs and meningeal irritation. In a psychological assessment, the patient exhibited clear consciousness, disorientation to place and time, passivity during interactions with few answers to questions, no hallucinations or delusions, a decline in memory and cognition; and a reduction in daily physical activities and energy levels.

A color Doppler ultrasound showed diffused thyroid lesions with nodular changes (nodules in the right lobe of the thyroid). Both a CT examination (Figure ) and an MRI (Figure ) of the head showed brain atrophy and leukoaraiosis. A chest CT and pelvic ultrasonography were normal. EEG recordings revealed diffuse slow waves. No epileptic activity or extreme delta brush was observed. The patient’s Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) score was 22, indicating moderate anxiety. Her Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score was 13, indicating a likelihood of depression. Her Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 14, indicating dementia.
The differential diagnosis was as follows: 1) rapidly progressive dementia, 2) type-II diabetes, and 3) subclinical hypothyroidism. After admission, the patient was treated with venlafaxine (75 mg/d) and oxazepam (15 mg/d).

92,"A 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, essential hypertension, class 3 obesity, depression, and poor social and economic background was intermittently followed during the previous four years for persistent cutaneous candidiasis with intertrigo in the inframammary, inguinal, and lower abdominal regions (Figure ).
She had been treated with topical antifungal, oral fluconazole and oral itraconazole with no improvement, which was believed to be because of poor hygiene and questionable therapeutic compliance. A worsening in the skin rash with exudate, pruritus, and a change to a violaceous colour, with scaly papules and vesicles (Figures , ) led to the performance of a skin biopsy which revealed (Figure ) orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis in the epidermis with areas of parakeratosis and, in the papillary dermis, there was an infiltrate of cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and reniform nuclei that showed positive CD1a and S100 proteins on the immunohistochemistry and negative CD163 (Figure ).
The patient denied constitutional, musculoskeletal, neurological, or urinary complaints. She underwent a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), thoracic-abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT), and bone scintigraphy. Brain MRI depicted mild chronic microvascular changes in the white matter, unchanged from a prior study. CT demonstrated a thickening of the renal pelvis (4 mm) in the right kidney with a slight urothelial dilation (Figure ). The rest of the exams did not reveal further organ involvement.
After considering the skin histology, the extensive cutaneous involvement, and the infiltrative urothelial involvement, it was evident this was a multi-system process. A consultation with Hematology/Oncology, led to induction treatment with prednisolone and vinblastine-based chemotherapy. At six weeks of chemotherapy, there was a partial regression of the skin lesions (Figure ) and a resolution of the urothelium lesion in imaging exam (CT).
The disease was in continuous regression and considering the extension of affected skin tissue a second round of chemotherapy with prednisolone and vinblastine was administered for six weeks. There was a resolution of all the lesions following this second round, and the patient underwent maintenance therapy consisting of administrating mercaptopurine daily and prednisolone/vinblastine every three weeks during 12 months, staying in remission (Figure ).

97,"A 41-year-old Japanese woman presented to our clinic with a 4 month history of bilateral groin pain and right buttock pain. Her right hip was more painful than her left hip. There was no history of trauma, alcohol abuse, or steroid use. Her medical history included iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed 2 years earlier, after which she had been on iron supplements. She had no fracture episodes, including fragility fractures.
Her height, body weight, and body mass index were 155 cm, 42 kg, and 18.7 kg/m2, respectively. She was able to walk for approximately 10 minutes without a stick, albeit at a slow speed. Limitations in the passive motion of her bilateral hip joint were observed thus: flexion, 100°, internal rotation 5°, external rotation 15°, and abduction 20°, on both sides. She was able to perform a straight-leg raise of the right limb with substantial pain. The neurovascular status of both lower extremities was intact. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association scoring system for the evaluation of hip-joint function (JOA hip score) was 46 points for her right hip and 56 points for her left hip. The score was based on a total of 100 points, comprising 40 for pain, 20 for range of motion, 20 for the ability to walk, and 20 for activities of daily living [].
Standard radiographs of both hips (Fig. a–c) demonstrated no characteristic findings such as the crescent sign, sclerotic band pattern, and collapse of the femoral head, and no joint space narrowing was seen in either femoral head. MRI of both hips (Fig. d, e) presented a low signal line in the subchondral region of the femoral head in the T1 weighted image and high signal region in almost all of the femoral head in the short tau inversion recovery (STIR). The oblique axial views of the proton density-weighted image showed a low-signal sinuous line in the anteromedial region of the femoral head (Fig. ). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) values were low in both femoral necks. Bone mineral density was 0.909 g/cm2 (T-score –0.9, Z-score −0.8) in the lumbar spine, 0.594 g/cm2 (T-score −1.8, Z-score −1.4) in the right femoral neck, and 0.529 g/cm2 (T-score −2.4, Z-score −2.0) in the left femoral neck. Laboratory findings were as follows: C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.03 mg/dl (normal range: 0–0.5 mg/dl); alkaline phosphatase 608 IU/l (40–150 IU/l); calcium 9.0 mg/dl (8.4–10.2 mg/dl); albumin 4.4 g/d (3.9–4.9 g/d); and hemoglobin 9.7 g/dl (12–16 g/dl). Bone turnover markers were as follows: tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP-5b) 463 mU/dl (premenopausal normal range: 120–420 mU/dl) and total procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (Total P1NP) 72.7 ng/ml (26.4–98.2 ng/ml). We diagnosed bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head and classified it as stage 1 in both femoral heads, according to the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) classification [].
The patient was instructed not to take as much weight as possible using sticks on the right side. Her symptoms improved immediately. However, 6 months later, her symptoms increased slightly without any traumatic episodes. Radiographic findings indicated almost no change (Fig. a–c). However, a slight signal change in the medial subcapital region was observed in the MRI scan (Fig. d, e). Her pain gradually increased thereafter, and 10 months after her first visit, walking became difficult. The JOA hip score decreased to 34 points in both hips; still, no changes could be observed in the radiograph (Fig. a–c). MRI of both hips showed a nondisplaced subcapital fracture on the medial side of both femoral necks, with bone marrow edema around the fracture (Fig. d, e). Because the cause of the fractures was not identified, the DEXA and bone turnover markers were measured again, and 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D was measured for the first time. All DEXA values decreased. The bone mineral density was 0.849 g/cm2 (T-score −1.5, Z-score −1.2) in the lumbar spine, 0.527 g/ cm2 (T-score −2.4, Z-score −2.1) in the right femoral neck, and 0.490 g/cm2 (T-score −2.7, Z-score −2.4) in the left femoral neck. TRACP-5b level increased to 607 mU/dl, and total P1NP decreased to 52.7 ng/ml. Her 25(OH) vitamin D level was 11.1 ng/dL and she was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. Based on the above results, our diagnosis was bilateral stress fracture of the femoral neck secondary to osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The patient underwent internal fixation of both hips with sliding hip screws (Dual SC screw system; Kisco, Kobe, Japan) to stabilize the stress fractures. In addition, the reaming performed before inserting of the sliding hip screw served as core decompression for the femoral heads [, ]. The specimens obtained from the reaming were examined histologically. Definitive findings of osteonecrosis such as bone marrow necrosis and loss of osteocyte nuclei in the femoral heads were observed (Fig. ). Postoperative radiographs showed no evidence of displacement of the fractures (Fig. ). We administered eldecalcitol 0.75 μg per day orally for vitamin D deficiency, and daily subcutaneous injections of teriparatide acetate. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient began to bear weight as tolerated with the use of an assistive device bilaterally. One month postoperatively, she was able to walk without pain and used a cane part time. She eventually regained full walking ability without a cane 3 months after surgery. Furthermore, her JOA hip score improved to 90 points in both hip joints at 5 months after surgery. Radiographs showed no evidence of recurrent stress fracture in the femoral neck or progression of osteonecrosis (Fig. ).

Bone mineral density was 0.909 g/cm2 (T-score –0.9, Z-score −0.8) in the lumbar spine, 0.594 g/cm2 (T-score −1.8, Z-score −1.4) in the right femoral neck, and 0.529 g/cm2 (T-score −2.4, Z-score −2.0) in the left femoral neck. Laboratory findings were as follows: C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.03 mg/dl (normal range: 0–0.5 mg/dl); alkaline phosphatase 608 IU/l (40–150 IU/l); calcium 9.0 mg/dl (8.4–10.2 mg/dl); albumin 4.4 g/d (3.9–4.9 g/d); and hemoglobin 9.7 g/dl (12–16 g/dl). Bone turnover markers were as follows: tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP-5b) 463 mU/dl (premenopausal normal range: 120–420 mU/dl) and total procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (Total P1NP) 72.7 ng/ml (26.4–98.2 ng/ml). We diagnosed bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head and classified it as stage 1 in both femoral heads, according to the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) classification [].
The patient was instructed not to take as much weight as possible using sticks on the right side. Her symptoms improved immediately. However, 6 months later, her symptoms increased slightly without any traumatic episodes. Radiographic findings indicated almost no change (Fig. a–c). However, a slight signal change in the medial subcapital region was observed in the MRI scan (Fig. d, e). Her pain gradually increased thereafter, and 10 months after her first visit, walking became difficult. The JOA hip score decreased to 34 points in both hips; still, no changes could be observed in the radiograph (Fig. a–c). MRI of both hips showed a nondisplaced subcapital fracture on the medial side of both femoral necks, with bone marrow edema around the fracture (Fig. d, e). Because the cause of the fractures was not identified, the DEXA and bone turnover markers were measured again, and 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D was measured for the first time. All DEXA values decreased. The bone mineral density was 0.849 g/cm2 (T-score −1.5, Z-score −1.2) in the lumbar spine, 0.527 g/ cm2 (T-score −2.4, Z-score −2.1) in the right femoral neck, and 0.490 g/cm2 (T-score −2.7, Z-score −2.4) in the left femoral neck. TRACP-5b level increased to 607 mU/dl, and total P1NP decreased to 52.7 ng/ml. Her 25(OH) vitamin D level was 11.1 ng/dL and she was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. Based on the above results, our diagnosis was bilateral stress fracture of the femoral neck secondary to osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The patient underwent internal fixation of both hips with sliding hip screws (Dual SC screw system; Kisco, Kobe, Japan) to stabilize the stress fractures. In addition, the reaming performed before inserting of the sliding hip screw served as core decompression for the femoral heads [, ]. The specimens obtained from the reaming were examined histologically. Definitive findings of osteonecrosis such as bone marrow necrosis and loss of osteocyte nuclei in the femoral heads were observed (Fig. ). Postoperative radiographs showed no evidence of displacement of the fractures (Fig. ). We administered eldecalcitol 0.75 μg per day orally for vitamin D deficiency, and daily subcutaneous injections of teriparatide acetate. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient began to bear weight as tolerated with the use of an assistive device bilaterally. One month postoperatively, she was able to walk without pain and used a cane part time. She eventually regained full walking ability without a cane 3 months after surgery. Furthermore, her JOA hip score improved to 90 points in both hip joints at 5 months after surgery. Radiographs showed no evidence of recurrent stress fracture in the femoral neck or progression of osteonecrosis (Fig. ). Sequential oblique axial MRI showed that the necrotic region of the femoral head had decreased 5 months after surgery (Fig. ).",screening tests for osteoporosis and osteopenia,knows common screening tests,"A 41-year-old woman presented with persistent bilateral groin and right buttock pain.

The bone mineral density was 0.849 g/cm2 (T-score −1.5, Z-score −1.2) in the lumbar spine, 0.527 g/ cm2 (T-score −2.4, Z-score −2.1) in the right femoral neck, and 0.490 g/cm2 (T-score −2.7, Z-score −2.4) in the left femoral neck. TRACP-5b level increased to 607 mU/dl, and total P1NP decreased to 52.7 ng/ml. Her 25(OH) vitamin D level was 11.1 ng/dL and she was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. Based on the above results, our diagnosis was bilateral stress fracture of the femoral neck secondary to osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The patient underwent internal fixation of both hips with sliding hip screws (Dual SC screw system; Kisco, Kobe, Japan) to stabilize the stress fractures. In addition, the reaming performed before inserting of the sliding hip screw served as core decompression for the femoral heads [, ]. The specimens obtained from the reaming were examined histologically. Definitive findings of osteonecrosis such as bone marrow necrosis and loss of osteocyte nuclei in the femoral heads were observed (Fig. ). Postoperative radiographs showed no evidence of displacement of the fractures (Fig. ). We administered eldecalcitol 0.75 μg per day orally for vitamin D deficiency, and daily subcutaneous injections of teriparatide acetate. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient began to bear weight as tolerated with the use of an assistive device bilaterally. One month postoperatively, she was able to walk without pain and used a cane part time. She eventually regained full walking ability without a cane 3 months after surgery. Furthermore, her JOA hip score improved to 90 points in both hip joints at 5 months after surgery. Radiographs showed no evidence of recurrent stress fracture in the femoral neck or progression of osteonecrosis (Fig. ). Sequential oblique axial MRI showed that the necrotic region of the femoral head had decreased 5 months after surgery (Fig. ).",management for osteonecrosis of the femoral head,most appropriate management of selected conditions,"A 41-year-old woman came to the clinic with persistent bilateral groin and right buttock pain.

A thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan revealed that the malignant tumor on the left upper lobe was complicated by distal obstructive inflammation, the enlargement of the left hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and the multiple bone metastases on 25 August 2019 (Fig. A). Immunohistochemical (IHC) results of the posterior iliac bone marrow biopsy specimen showed the positive expression of CD3, CD20, CD34, CD235a, and NPO, and the negative CD61 expression. IHC results of an endoscopic biopsy specimen of the bronchial mucosa on the upper left lobe showed the positive expression of TTF1, CK7, NapsinA, Ki67, CK, and EMA, and the negative expression of CK5/6, P40, CgA, Syn, and CD45 on 6 September 2019. Histopathologic observations showed infiltration of atypia cells in mucosal and fibrous tissues. The detection tools of pathology and cytology included automatic IHC staining (BenchMark XT, Roche, The United States), digital slice scanner, image analysis software (Pannoramic 250, 3DHistech, Hungary), and microscope (Eclipse Ci-S, Nikon, Japan). Finally, the patient was diagnosed with stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma combing with bone metastases.
To seek potential therapeutic opportunities, the FFPE tissue and control sample (white blood cell) of the patient were detected using a 733-gene NGS panel in a College of American Pathologists (CAP) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certificated lab. Sequencing reads were mapped against the hg19/GRCh37 genome, and duplicate reads were removed, followed by variants calling in targeted regions using an in-house developed bioinformatics algorithm. The algorithm utilized a filtering model containing background error correction, strand bias, base quality, mapping quality, short tandem repeat regions, and low-quality mapping ratio 25 []. The NGS analysis results indicated that the patient had an EGFR exon 19 p.L747_S752del somatic mutation with an allelic fraction of 73.19% and TP53 p.H179L germline mutation. Besides, the whole chromosome 7 and 5q deletion were detected using NGS-based copy number variation (CNV) analyses (Fig. ), which were classical abnormalities associated with MDS. According to the clinical inquiry, the patient was a farmer by occupation, which means that he has long been exposed to certain chemicals such as pesticides, fertilizers, and solvents containing benzene. In addition, he smoked for 40 years. Taking all these findings together, we suspected the patient with secondary MDS. The results of the physiological blood indexes and the bone marrow aspiration test showed a decrease of platelet counts and the elevation of myelocyte counts.

According to the clinical inquiry, the patient was a farmer by occupation, which means that he has long been exposed to certain chemicals such as pesticides, fertilizers, and solvents containing benzene. In addition, he smoked for 40 years. Taking all these findings together, we suspected the patient with secondary MDS. The results of the physiological blood indexes and the bone marrow aspiration test showed a decrease of platelet counts and the elevation of myelocyte counts. The proportion of blast was 5%, and the morphology of the cells presented the characteristics of MDS, which further confirmed our speculation (Fig. and Additional file : Fig. S1).
In terms of treatment, the EGFR-positive mutation patient was administered with gefitinib starting from 20 August 2019. Due to decreasing platelet counts, azacitidine was administrated for four courses of treatment. However, the thrombocytopenia had not been significantly improved, and the size of the maximal tumor in the lung lesion did not decrease after seven months’ treatment (Fig. B). On 10 April 2020, a pathological report showed the infiltration of poorly differentiated cancer cells into the fibrous tissue. IHC results suggested the neuroendocrine tumor, in which small cell carcinoma and atypical carcinoid tumor accounted for about 40% and 60%, respectively. On 7 April and 28 April 2020, considering positive PD-L1 expression and high tumor mutation burden (TMB) in the tissue sample, the patient was administrated with toripalimab (a PD-1 inhibitor) and bevacizumab. Platelet counts returned to near-normal levels gradually, and the tumor lesion shrank obviously (Fig. ). It was concluded that the patient reached a partial response (PR) (Fig. C). The progression-free survival was four months.","EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as osimertinib, gefitinib) for EGFR mutation positive lung adenocarcinoma.",selects most appropriate pharmacotherapy,"A 66-year-old male patient, working as a farmer, presented with back pain and cough persisting for two weeks.

114,"A 14-year-old male adolescent presented to the emergency department with subfebrile temperatures for 1 week and localized pain in his right popliteal fossa for 3 days. Prior to the onset of these symptoms, he had been immobilized for several days following a minor sports injury.
The adolescent had no permanent medication and no prior medical history except for an asymptomatic ATD diagnosed at the age of six by functional antithrombin assay (antithrombin activity of 57%, age adapted reference: 77–125%). Since at that time, there were no clinical signs of thrombosis, the diagnosis of ATD did not lead to any therapeutic consequences. Screening for ATD at this early age had been carried out on parental request, as his mother was diagnosed with ATD in her early adulthood. Interestingly, his mother now reported that she had very recently been diagnosed with IVCA (preexisting chromogenic test results showed an antithrombin activity of 50% for the mother, the age adjusted reference range being 80 to 130%).
The coexistence of other hereditary thrombophilic disorders in our patient and his mother (protein S deficiency, protein C deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin-mutation, antiphospholipid syndrome) was ruled out by respective laboratory analyses.
Laboratory blood analysis in the emergency department showed markedly elevated D-dimers of 25 mg/l FEU (reference: < 0.5 mg/l FEU) and of C-reactive protein (CrP) of 184 mg/l (reference < 5 mg/l). Antithrombin activity on admission was reduced to 61% (age adjusted reference 83–118%).
A vascular ultrasound examination upon admission confirmed the clinically suspected thrombosis of the right lower extremity involving the external iliac, common and superficial femoral as well as the popliteal vein. The ultrasound examination of the left lower extremity veins did not give evidence of thromboses upon admission. The patient was treated with continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin at a therapeutical dose including several bolus administrations and antithrombin (4000 IE within the first 36 h) was substituted reaching levels in the target range between 80 and 100%. Subsequent monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) showed an insufficient response to heparin treatment (aPTT was 29 s before the administration of heparin and did not exceed a maximum value of 33.6 s during heparin treatment). The anticoagulative therapy was therefore switched to direct thrombin inhibition by argatroban at a dose of 1.5–2.0 μg/kg/min, which led to target aPTT values of 50–60s.
Due to the elevated CrP levels and subfebrile temperatures, empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous cefuroxim was initiated.
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan on day three confirmed a complete DVT of the right lower extremity, and now additionally extended thromboses of the left lower extremity and thrombosis of both iliac vessels. Furthermore, it revealed an occlusion of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with prominent venous lumbar collaterals, suggestive of IVCA. Surrounding the lumbar vertebrae, several of these collaterals appeared to be fully thrombotic, which was confirmed by angiography (Fig. A).
The following day, a catheter-directed local thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) at a daily dose of 0.25 mg/kg was initiated in both extremities and carried out for a total of 48 h. For the right leg, an additional ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis using the EKOS® system was performed.
During hospitalization, the anticoagulative therapy was switched from argatroban to the vitamin K antagonist phenprocoumon with a target International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.0–2.5. Oral anticoagulation will most likely be continued lifelong due to the combination of extended multilocal thromboses with underlying ATD, as well as IVCA, which in itself is a risk factor for thrombosis.
The patient was discharged on day eight after hospital admission. An ultrasound examination upon discharge showed full recanalization of the femoral and iliac veins of both legs.
During a routine follow-up 1 week later, the patient presented free of any clinical complaints. However, despite continued oral anticoagulation since hospital discharge, vascular ultrasound now revealed extended re-thrombosis of both the right and left pelvic axis and the right lower extremity, thus leading to a second hospital admission and re-induction of therapy with both intravenous antithrombin and catheter-directed thrombolysis.
Recanalization of the right lower extremity and pelvic axis was subsequently achieved, whereby IVC occlusion was confirmed (Fig. B). However, the left pelvic vessels remained thrombotic even after 5 days of catheter-directed thrombolysis.
Surprisingly, one of the angiographies allowed for location of the occluded area of the IVC by rendezvous-technique between the superior and inferior vena cava, which prior to this had been thought to be atretic (Fig. C). The vessel was successfully recanalized using balloon dilation and subsequent stenting (Fig. D).
Throughout the clinical stay, the patient’s oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon was intensified to a new target INR of 2.5–3.0 in order to prevent re-thrombosis.
The patient was discharged from hospital on day seven after admission. Regular follow-up examinations at our outpatient clinic did not give evidence for any new thrombotic events to date (time since first occurrence of thrombosis was 9 months).
Concerning the thrombotic left iliac vessels, a follow-up angiographic intervention relying on special equipment was performed, but recanalization could not be achieved.

She received total intravenous anesthesia: continuous infusions of propofol and remifentanil. Noradrenaline and dopamine were infused continuously through the central venous catheter to maintain blood pressure. AS disappeared after valve implantation. During the surgery, complete atrioventricular block occurred, and ventricular pacing (VVI mode: 60 ppm) was initiated. No other complications were associated with the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, she received 100 mg sugammadex through the central venous catheter, but 2 min later, her systolic arterial blood pressure (ABP) decreased unexpectedly to less than 40 mmHg. Simultaneously, ventilator monitoring revealed elevated peak and plateau airway pressures (60 and 40 cmH2O, respectively). No skin rash was observed on the body surface. Transthoracic echocardiography showed underfilling of the left ventricle without right ventricular dilatation or pericardial effusion. No abnormalities were observed in left ventricular wall motion.
The patient developed distributive shock, which was clinically diagnosed as anaphylactic shock caused by sugammadex because of the rapid onset of severe hypotension and bronchospasm. First, two boluses of 0.05 mg adrenaline were administered through the central venous catheter, followed by rapid volume resuscitation using crystalloid (1 L infusion within 30 min). The dose of noradrenaline was increased to 0.3 μg/kg/min. Consequently, the airway pressures returned to the original level, but the hypotension persisted. Thereafter, adrenaline was administered via bolus (0.1 mg twice) and continuous infusion (0.1 μg/kg/min); however, the increase in her ABP was minimal. Therefore, 1 mg glucagon was administered intravenously, and her systolic ABP immediately rose to 130 mmHg. An erythematous rash also appeared on her neck with the increase in ABP. Her general condition was stable after the therapeutic interventions. Ventricular pacing was continued because bradycardia with complete atrioventricular block was persistent during the interventions. She was admitted to the intensive care unit under tracheal intubation. Subsequently, the continuous infusion of adrenaline was discontinued, and the continuous infusion of noradrenaline was reduced. We also administered 125 mg methylprednisolone for 3 days. She was extubated 9 h after the onset of anaphylaxis, and circulatory agonists were discontinued the following day. She was discharged without complications on postoperative day 9. Blood tests revealed a total serum tryptase level of 7.3 ng/mL and 1.2 ng/mL at 1 h and 24 h after onset, respectively. We advised the patient to undergo allergy tests, such as skin prick tests or intradermal tests, to identify the cause of anaphylaxis. However, the patient refused these tests because she was elderly and unlikely to undergo surgery under general anesthesia in the future.

133,"A 41-year-old Japanese woman presented to our clinic with a 4 month history of bilateral groin pain and right buttock pain. Her right hip was more painful than her left hip. There was no history of trauma, alcohol abuse, or steroid use. Her medical history included iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed 2 years earlier, after which she had been on iron supplements. She had no fracture episodes, including fragility fractures.
Her height, body weight, and body mass index were 155 cm, 42 kg, and 18.7 kg/m2, respectively. She was able to walk for approximately 10 minutes without a stick, albeit at a slow speed. Limitations in the passive motion of her bilateral hip joint were observed thus: flexion, 100°, internal rotation 5°, external rotation 15°, and abduction 20°, on both sides. She was able to perform a straight-leg raise of the right limb with substantial pain. The neurovascular status of both lower extremities was intact. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association scoring system for the evaluation of hip-joint function (JOA hip score) was 46 points for her right hip and 56 points for her left hip. The score was based on a total of 100 points, comprising 40 for pain, 20 for range of motion, 20 for the ability to walk, and 20 for activities of daily living [].
Standard radiographs of both hips (Fig. a–c) demonstrated no characteristic findings such as the crescent sign, sclerotic band pattern, and collapse of the femoral head, and no joint space narrowing was seen in either femoral head. MRI of both hips (Fig. d, e) presented a low signal line in the subchondral region of the femoral head in the T1 weighted image and high signal region in almost all of the femoral head in the short tau inversion recovery (STIR). The oblique axial views of the proton density-weighted image showed a low-signal sinuous line in the anteromedial region of the femoral head (Fig. ). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) values were low in both femoral necks. Bone mineral density was 0.909 g/cm2 (T-score –0.9, Z-score −0.8) in the lumbar spine, 0.594 g/cm2 (T-score −1.8, Z-score −1.4) in the right femoral neck, and 0.529 g/cm2 (T-score −2.4, Z-score −2.0) in the left femoral neck. Laboratory findings were as follows: C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.03 mg/dl (normal range: 0–0.5 mg/dl); alkaline phosphatase 608 IU/l (40–150 IU/l); calcium 9.0 mg/dl (8.4–10.2 mg/dl); albumin 4.4 g/d (3.9–4.9 g/d); and hemoglobin 9.7 g/dl (12–16 g/dl). Bone turnover markers were as follows: tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP-5b) 463 mU/dl (premenopausal normal range: 120–420 mU/dl) and total procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (Total P1NP) 72.7 ng/ml (26.4–98.2 ng/ml). We diagnosed bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head and classified it as stage 1 in both femoral heads, according to the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) classification [].
The patient was instructed not to take as much weight as possible using sticks on the right side. Her symptoms improved immediately. However, 6 months later, her symptoms increased slightly without any traumatic episodes. Radiographic findings indicated almost no change (Fig. a–c). However, a slight signal change in the medial subcapital region was observed in the MRI scan (Fig. d, e). Her pain gradually increased thereafter, and 10 months after her first visit, walking became difficult. The JOA hip score decreased to 34 points in both hips; still, no changes could be observed in the radiograph (Fig. a–c). MRI of both hips showed a nondisplaced subcapital fracture on the medial side of both femoral necks, with bone marrow edema around the fracture (Fig. d, e). Because the cause of the fractures was not identified, the DEXA and bone turnover markers were measured again, and 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D was measured for the first time. All DEXA values decreased. The bone mineral density was 0.849 g/cm2 (T-score −1.5, Z-score −1.2) in the lumbar spine, 0.527 g/ cm2 (T-score −2.4, Z-score −2.1) in the right femoral neck, and 0.490 g/cm2 (T-score −2.7, Z-score −2.4) in the left femoral neck. TRACP-5b level increased to 607 mU/dl, and total P1NP decreased to 52.7 ng/ml. Her 25(OH) vitamin D level was 11.1 ng/dL and she was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. Based on the above results, our diagnosis was bilateral stress fracture of the femoral neck secondary to osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The patient underwent internal fixation of both hips with sliding hip screws (Dual SC screw system; Kisco, Kobe, Japan) to stabilize the stress fractures. In addition, the reaming performed before inserting of the sliding hip screw served as core decompression for the femoral heads [, ]. The specimens obtained from the reaming were examined histologically. Definitive findings of osteonecrosis such as bone marrow necrosis and loss of osteocyte nuclei in the femoral heads were observed (Fig. ). Postoperative radiographs showed no evidence of displacement of the fractures (Fig. ). We administered eldecalcitol 0.75 μg per day orally for vitamin D deficiency, and daily subcutaneous injections of teriparatide acetate. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient began to bear weight as tolerated with the use of an assistive device bilaterally. One month postoperatively, she was able to walk without pain and used a cane part time. She eventually regained full walking ability without a cane 3 months after surgery. Furthermore, her JOA hip score improved to 90 points in both hip joints at 5 months after surgery. Radiographs showed no evidence of recurrent stress fracture in the femoral neck or progression of osteonecrosis (Fig. ). Sequential oblique axial MRI showed that the necrotic region of the femoral head had decreased 5 months after surgery (Fig. ).",regulation of bone remodeling,underlying processes/pathways,"A 41-year-old Japanese woman with a history of iron-deficiency anemia presented with a 4 month history of bilateral groin pain, which was more severe on the right side.

Radiographs of both hips showed no characteristic findings, and MRI images demonstrated a low signal line in the subchondral region of the femoral head. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) values were low in both femoral necks. Laboratory findings indicated a normal C-reactive protein level, increased alkaline phosphatase, normal calcium and albumin, and decreased hemoglobin. Bone turnover markers were increased.

135,"A 41-year-old Japanese woman presented to our clinic with a 4 month history of bilateral groin pain and right buttock pain. Her right hip was more painful than her left hip. There was no history of trauma, alcohol abuse, or steroid use. Her medical history included iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed 2 years earlier, after which she had been on iron supplements. She had no fracture episodes, including fragility fractures.
Her height, body weight, and body mass index were 155 cm, 42 kg, and 18.7 kg/m2, respectively. She was able to walk for approximately 10 minutes without a stick, albeit at a slow speed. Limitations in the passive motion of her bilateral hip joint were observed thus: flexion, 100°, internal rotation 5°, external rotation 15°, and abduction 20°, on both sides. She was able to perform a straight-leg raise of the right limb with substantial pain. The neurovascular status of both lower extremities was intact. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association scoring system for the evaluation of hip-joint function (JOA hip score) was 46 points for her right hip and 56 points for her left hip. The score was based on a total of 100 points, comprising 40 for pain, 20 for range of motion, 20 for the ability to walk, and 20 for activities of daily living [].
Standard radiographs of both hips (Fig. a–c) demonstrated no characteristic findings such as the crescent sign, sclerotic band pattern, and collapse of the femoral head, and no joint space narrowing was seen in either femoral head. MRI of both hips (Fig. d, e) presented a low signal line in the subchondral region of the femoral head in the T1 weighted image and high signal region in almost all of the femoral head in the short tau inversion recovery (STIR). The oblique axial views of the proton density-weighted image showed a low-signal sinuous line in the anteromedial region of the femoral head (Fig. ). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) values were low in both femoral necks. Bone mineral density was 0.909 g/cm2 (T-score –0.9, Z-score −0.8) in the lumbar spine, 0.594 g/cm2 (T-score −1.8, Z-score −1.4) in the right femoral neck, and 0.529 g/cm2 (T-score −2.4, Z-score −2.0) in the left femoral neck. Laboratory findings were as follows: C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.03 mg/dl (normal range: 0–0.5 mg/dl); alkaline phosphatase 608 IU/l (40–150 IU/l); calcium 9.0 mg/dl (8.4–10.2 mg/dl); albumin 4.4 g/d (3.9–4.9 g/d); and hemoglobin 9.7 g/dl (12–16 g/dl). Bone turnover markers were as follows: tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP-5b) 463 mU/dl (premenopausal normal range: 120–420 mU/dl) and total procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (Total P1NP) 72.7 ng/ml (26.4–98.2 ng/ml). We diagnosed bilateral osteonecrosis of the femoral head and classified it as stage 1 in both femoral heads, according to the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) classification [].
The patient was instructed not to take as much weight as possible using sticks on the right side. Her symptoms improved immediately. However, 6 months later, her symptoms increased slightly without any traumatic episodes. Radiographic findings indicated almost no change (Fig. a–c). However, a slight signal change in the medial subcapital region was observed in the MRI scan (Fig. d, e). Her pain gradually increased thereafter, and 10 months after her first visit, walking became difficult. The JOA hip score decreased to 34 points in both hips; still, no changes could be observed in the radiograph (Fig. a–c). MRI of both hips showed a nondisplaced subcapital fracture on the medial side of both femoral necks, with bone marrow edema around the fracture (Fig. d, e). Because the cause of the fractures was not identified, the DEXA and bone turnover markers were measured again, and 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D was measured for the first time. All DEXA values decreased. The bone mineral density was 0.849 g/cm2 (T-score −1.5, Z-score −1.2) in the lumbar spine, 0.527 g/ cm2 (T-score −2.4, Z-score −2.1) in the right femoral neck, and 0.490 g/cm2 (T-score −2.7, Z-score −2.4) in the left femoral neck. TRACP-5b level increased to 607 mU/dl, and total P1NP decreased to 52.7 ng/ml. Her 25(OH) vitamin D level was 11.1 ng/dL and she was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency.

137,"A 72-year-old male, known hypertensive on medication, non-smoker, no family history of cancer presented with complaints of pain in the right hip with difficulty in walking in January 2019. On evaluation, a pathological fracture was found at the neck of the right femur. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine was done, which revealed osteophyte complexes at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6 vertebrae causing narrowing of neural foramina. Multiple T2-hyperintense lesions in lung parenchyma were an incidental finding. Upon further evaluation with positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan of the whole body, mass in the apex of the right lung, right hilum, mediastinal lymph node, soft tissue wall thickening in the proximal stomach along with multiple liver and bone metastases were found. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy revealed a proximal gastric growth from which a biopsy was taken. Histopathology showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. A provisional diagnosis of carcinoma stomach with distant metastasis was reached. But immunohistochemistry came out to be positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and cytokeratin-7 (CK-7), while negative for cytokeratin 20 (CK-20) (Figures -).
So, a possibility of metastasis from a lung primary was considered. It was confirmed by a biopsy from the lung mass that revealed adenocarcinoma as the histopathology. On immunohistochemistry, it was positive for TTF-1 and CK-7 while negative for CK-20 and synaptophysin. Analysis for anaplastic lymphoma kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor, and receptor tyrosine kinase 1 were all negative but programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) was 90%. So, the final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma lung with multiple lung, liver, femur, as well as gastric metastases.
For the pathological fracture, he underwent fixation by intramedullary nailing followed by palliative external beam radiotherapy 8 Gy in a single fraction. He received 10 three-weekly cycles each of Inj. pembrolizumab 200 mg as intravenous infusion and Inj. denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously from March 2019 to September 2019. An interim PET-CT scan done after four cycles of immunotherapy in June 2019 showed a near-complete metabolic response (Figures -).
After 10 cycles, Inj. pembrolizumab was discontinued as the patient was unwilling to continue due to personal reasons. He was then started with chemotherapy, Inj. pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and Inj. bevacizumab 15 mg/kg in October 2019. Following this, the patient developed grade 1 maculopapular rash, pedal edema, and grade 2 diarrhea, which were managed conservatively. After that the patient did not opt for the continuation of chemotherapy. The next visit of the patient was in February 2021 with complaints of cough and breathlessness. On re-evaluation with PET-CT scan, progressive disease was found in the primary site (Figures , ).
Palliative radiotherapy of 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the primary lesion was delivered through anteroposterior and posteroanterior portals of 10 megavolt energy each in April 2021 via linear accelerator (Elekta-Versa HD) which was tolerated well (Figure ).
In June, the patient developed an altered sensorium and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of brain revealed multiple brain metastases for which the patient received palliative whole-brain radiotherapy of 30 Gy in 10 fractions over two weeks from the same linear accelerator.

Narrow-band imaging (NBI) under endoscopy revealed the lesion with an indistinct brownish area, local white penniform area, and white tiny papillary surface structure (Fig. b). Further low and high magnifying endoscopy with NBI (ME-NBI) showed tiny irregular papillary microsurface structure with various shapes and sizes, and non-typical type B1 pattern of intraepithelial papillary capillary loops (IPCL) confined to the papillary microsurface structure (Fig. c, low magnification, and Fig. d, high magnification) according to the classification of Japan Esophagus Society (JES classification) [].

According to the endoscopic manifestations under WLE, ME-NBI, and iodine staining endoscopy, combining with pathology, we considered the lesion to be early esophageal cancer. Therefore we chose endoscopic therapy. The lesion was completely resected with endoscopic submucosal dissection.

The IPCL were observed in lamina propria papilla with elongating upward to the surface layer growing underneath the layer of neoplastic spinous cells, which corresponds to the IPCL observed by ME-NBI (Fig. e). The lesion was histopathologically confirmed as early VCCE which was limited within the mucosal lamina propria (m2) and completely resected.

156,"A 56-year-old gentleman with no comorbidities presented with progressive jaundice, anorexia, and weight loss of 6 to 8 weeks of duration. He had no similar complaints in past. His clinical examination apart from icterus was unremarkable. Investigations revealed direct hyperbilirubinemia of 10.3 mg/dL. Ultrasound abdomen revealed a hypoechoic lesion in head of pancreas 4 cm × 3 cm in size with dilated common bile duct and intrahepatic biliary radical dilatation.
A pancreatic protocol CECT scan was performed which confirmed the ultrasound findings. In addition to this, there was intestinal nonrotation with entire small bowel on right of abdomen and large bowel on left side. Cecum and hepatic flexure was in midline. SMA was seen coursing between the jejunal and ileal branch of SMV and to right of SMV as shown in
. There was no significant lymphadenopathy, liver lesions, or free fluid. These findings were suggestive of pancreatic head adenocarcinoma with intestinal nonrotation. CA 19–9 was elevated at 237 U/mL (normal: < 37 U/mL) and Carcinoembryonic antigen was normal. A pancreaticoduodenectomy was planned for the patient.
During surgery, the small bowel loops were clumped in right upper abdomen and the duodenum was vertically linear instead of the usual C loop configuration, with duodenojejunal flexure on the right side. Kocher's maneuver was performed (
). The infracolic SMA first approach helps to identify the vascular structures, as well as the replaced hepatic artery from SMA early in surgery, thereby reducing bleeding and it was our approach in this case. SMA and both ileal and jejunal branches of SMV were identified and looped at the lower border of pancreas. Inferior pancreaticodeuodenal vessels were identified to its origin and then divided. Hepatoduodenal ligament dissection was then performed. The retropancreatic tunnel was created in a plane above the portal vein superiorly and the SMV inferiorly, and then the plane was widened till the area above SMA and then above ileal branch of SMV, as we kept dissecting from left to right (
). Uncinate dissection, duodenojejunal flexure mobilization, and standard lymphadenectomy were then performed followed by division of jejunum at a slightly longer distance from the duodenojejunal flexure to gain mobility of mesentery to allow length for anastomosis, division of first part of duodenum, common bile duct, and pancreas.

Continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion of 240 μg/day was resumed, and these symptoms disappeared. However, restlessness occurred each time the dose was reduced. Therefore, a transdermal fentanyl patch was initiated to taper the opioid more slowly. Pancreatitis with abdominal pain recurred transiently one month later. Therefore, continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion was resumed, titrated to 600 μg/day. The dose was gradually decreased daily (600, 300, 240, 180, 120, and 60 μg/day). Once the pancreatitis had improved, the fentanyl could be discontinued without causing withdrawal symptoms.

One year post-transplant, he developed severe acute pancreatitis, which resulted in intense abdominal pain. He was admitted to the hospital and started on a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl at 1200 μg/day to control the pain. The fentanyl dose was progressively increased, due to the intensity of the pain, reaching a maximum of 2400 μg/day. Alongside, he was also managed with a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotic, and fluid therapy which helped alleviate the pancreatitis and abdominal pain. However, when the fentanyl was discontinued after reaching a lower dose of 240 μg/day, the patient developed withdrawal symptoms. As a result, a transdermal fentanyl patch was introduced to gradually taper off the opioid. When pancreatitis recurred a month later, the fentanyl infusion was resumed and gradually decreased daily. Eventually, once the pancreatitis improved, the fentanyl was successfully discontinued without causing withdrawal symptoms, 64 days after the onset of withdrawal symptoms.

On presentation to the hospital, the patient had left facial droop, bilateral pinpoint pupils, and right-sided weakness. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission was 26, suggesting a severe stroke. All other observations on admission were non-revealing, including vital signs, biochemical tests, and systems review.
The patient’s neurological medical history included two previous transient ischemic attacks and suspected dementia. Other past medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, adult polycystic kidney disease, hypercholesterolemia, and aortic valve sclerosis. He was an ex-smoker of unknown pack-years and prior to admission was living independently.
Initial head CT performed only showed chronic small vessel disease with periventricular leukoaraiosis, consistent with his age. Thrombolysis was initiated with an intravenous tissue-plasminogen activator, however, the patient’s GCS declined to 6/15 approximately 40 minutes after the start of thrombolysis. A repeat head CT was performed, again showing no acute findings. To prevent further deterioration, a decision to monitor the patient’s condition conservatively was made.
Over the next few days, the patient remained very somnolent. When the patient was able to awaken, he was only capable of responding to simple commands. Speech and language therapists noted that fatigue was limiting conversations, with the patient speaking with imprecise articulation and at a low volume. Occupational therapists concurred that the patient was poorly engaged during sessions, while physiotherapists classified this patient as having limited rehabilitation potential.
Stroke was finally confirmed upon a third head CT several days after admission, which showed bilateral thalamic infarcts.

CT scan showed peripancreatic edema and fat stranding, consistent with acute pancreatitis (Figure ). A repeat CT scan was done to evaluate the progression of her pancreatitis, which showed worsening pancreatitis with developing ascites.

172,"An 88-year-old woman (height, 150 cm; weight, 41 kg) with no history of drug allergy or general anesthesia was scheduled for transfemoral TAVI because of severe aortic stenosis (AS). The surgery was performed under general anesthesia to facilitate the use of transesophageal echocardiography and to manage any intraoperative complications. She was taking 0.625 mg/day bisoprolol, a selective β-1 blocker, for hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation. Additionally, she was taking amlodipine for hypertension. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography showed severe AS (aortic valve peak flow velocity: 4.73 m/s; mean aortic valve pressure gradient: 47 mmHg; aortic valve area: 0.41 cm2) and myocardial hypertrophy (left ventricular posterior wall thickness and interventricular septum thickness: 14 mm).
Pre-anesthetic medication for sedation was not administered. She received bisoprolol and amlodipine 3 h before entering the operating room. Figure shows the anesthesia record. General anesthesia was induced using midazolam and remifentanil; additionally, rocuronium was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation. She received total intravenous anesthesia: continuous infusions of propofol and remifentanil. Noradrenaline and dopamine were infused continuously through the central venous catheter to maintain blood pressure. AS disappeared after valve implantation. During the surgery, complete atrioventricular block occurred, and ventricular pacing (VVI mode: 60 ppm) was initiated. No other complications were associated with the surgical procedure. Postoperatively, she received 100 mg sugammadex through the central venous catheter, but 2 min later, her systolic arterial blood pressure (ABP) decreased unexpectedly to less than 40 mmHg. Simultaneously, ventilator monitoring revealed elevated peak and plateau airway pressures (60 and 40 cmH2O, respectively). No skin rash was observed on the body surface. Transthoracic echocardiography showed underfilling of the left ventricle without right ventricular dilatation or pericardial effusion. No abnormalities were observed in left ventricular wall motion.
The patient developed distributive shock, which was clinically diagnosed as anaphylactic shock caused by sugammadex because of the rapid onset of severe hypotension and bronchospasm. First, two boluses of 0.05 mg adrenaline were administered through the central venous catheter, followed by rapid volume resuscitation using crystalloid (1 L infusion within 30 min). The dose of noradrenaline was increased to 0.3 μg/kg/min. Consequently, the airway pressures returned to the original level, but the hypotension persisted. Thereafter, adrenaline was administered via bolus (0.1 mg twice) and continuous infusion (0.1 μg/kg/min); however, the increase in her ABP was minimal. Therefore, 1 mg glucagon was administered intravenously, and her systolic ABP immediately rose to 130 mmHg. An erythematous rash also appeared on her neck with the increase in ABP. Her general condition was stable after the therapeutic interventions. Ventricular pacing was continued because bradycardia with complete atrioventricular block was persistent during the interventions. She was admitted to the intensive care unit under tracheal intubation. Subsequently, the continuous infusion of adrenaline was discontinued, and the continuous infusion of noradrenaline was reduced. We also administered 125 mg methylprednisolone for 3 days. She was extubated 9 h after the onset of anaphylaxis, and circulatory agonists were discontinued the following day. She was discharged without complications on postoperative day 9. Blood tests revealed a total serum tryptase level of 7.3 ng/mL and 1.2 ng/mL at 1 h and 24 h after onset, respectively. We advised the patient to undergo allergy tests, such as skin prick tests or intradermal tests, to identify the cause of anaphylaxis. However, the patient refused these tests because she was elderly and unlikely to undergo surgery under general anesthesia in the future.
Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.

173,"A 19-year-old man presented to our institute with right hand and foot dyskinesia. He had a significant family history of PKD. His uncle, grandfather, and grandfather's brother had involuntary movements triggered by voluntary movements. Proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) on chromosome 16, which is associated with movement disorders including PKD (PRRT2-PxMD), was confirmed in his uncle and grandfather through genetic testing (c.649delC/pArg217-Glufs). All of them underwent stereotactic ablative surgery (Vo thalamotomy). The patient's grandfather and grandfather's brother experienced complete remission of involuntary movement attacks after the surgery. His uncle experienced a significant reduction in the frequency of daily attacks without medication. The patient first experienced paroxysmal involuntary left hand and toe flexion with left forearm pronation triggered by sudden voluntary movements at the age of 14. The frequency of attacks was 20–30 per day. Carbamazepine (100 mg/day) was prescribed, which led to a significant reduction in the frequency of attacks. However, drowsiness was significant after the intake of carbamazepine and significantly interfered with his daily life, especially school life. He underwent right-sided Vo thalamotomy at the age of 15, which resulted in complete resolution of PKD attacks immediately after the surgery. The detailed clinical course of right-sided Vo thalamotomy has been reported previously (). Four months after the thalamotomy, the patient developed right elbow, hand, and toe flexion (). The frequency of attacks was 10–20 per day. The duration of the attacks ranged from 10 to 20 seconds. Carbamazepine (100 mg/day) was prescribed again, and the PKD attacks reduced to 5–10 times per day. However, the drowsiness induced by carbamazepine severely interfered with his daily and school lives. He underwent left-sided Vo thalamotomy at the age of 19. The target coordinate of the left Vo nucleus was set the same as in the previous surgery (15-mm lateral, 2-mm posterior, and 1-mm superior to the midpoint of the anterior commissure-posterior commissure). A total of six lesions were created on the left Vo nucleus in the same manner as in the previous surgery. Immediately after surgery, the PKD attacks resolved completely. However, mild dysarthria developed, which spontaneously resolved within three months. Left-sided PKD attacks never developed six years after the right Vo thalamotomy, and right-sided PKD attacks never developed two years after the left Vo thalamotomy without medication. The locations of the coagulated lesions were confirmed using Brainlab Elements. Bilateral lesions covered the Vo and ventral intermediate (Vim) nuclei (). The Vo nucleus is located just anterior to the Vim nucleus of the thalamus. We included both anterior and posterior coagulated lesions in order to cover the entire Vo nucleus. Based on our experience, insufficient lesions to cover the Vo nucleus are likely to develop symptomatic recurrence. The time course of PKD onset and intervention is shown in .

The patient had received two doses of the COVID vaccine, with the second dose in March 2021. Upon arrival to the general medical ward, the patient's vital signs were BP 132/79, HR 84 bpm, RR 18 breaths/min, oxygen saturation of 100% on 2-4 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, and afebrile. Laboratory assessment is in Table . The patient was quickly weaned to room air, with SpO2 of 94-98%; hence, only supportive care was provided for COVID-19. On Day 1, the patient was found to have a right foot wound infection and was started on intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. On Day 2, the patient was found to be hypoxic, put on 5 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, and started on dexamethasone and remdesivir. Because of end-stage renal disease, the patient did not qualify for baricitinib. On Day 4, the patient required 10 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula, which he needed until Day 12, when we could start weaning down the supplemental oxygen over the next 3-4 days until Day 15 to room air. On Day 17, the patient was put back on 2 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula which quickly escalated to 15 L on a nonrebreather mask within 2-3 hours, requiring the patient to get transferred to the intensive care unit on Day 18. At this time, he was put on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) with 40 L per minute of supplemental oxygen. Chest X-ray showed extensive diffuse airspace infiltrates, which significantly worsened from one week prior (Figure ). He was dialyzed without improvement from a respiratory standpoint and then intubated on Day 19. Subsequently, the patient was restarted on dexamethasone and broad-spectrum antibiotics despite completing 14 days' worth previously.","COVID-19, ARDS",select most likely diagnosis,"A 48-year-old man, known to have diabetes and end-stage renal disease, came to the hospital with breathing difficulties.

192," A 54-year-old Caucasian male patient was referred to our institution, initially with the diagnosis of a T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, which was refractory to two courses of chemotherapy (CHOEP: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, vincristine, etoposide and prednisolone). At presentation an erythroderma involving >90% of the integument was predominant (). Computer tomography (CT) scans showed enlarged axillary, inguinal and cervical lymph nodes. The complete blood counts showed a leukocytosis of 24,300/µl. Flow cytometry of the pb revealed 11,664 Sézary cells/µl with CD4+CD7- phenotype and with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 85.5. Flow cytometry of the bone marrow aspirate confirmed CD30 positivity with expression of 7% in Sézary cells. Polymerase chain reaction of pb confirmed the clonality in T-cell receptor beta and gamma showing monoclonal Vβ-β2 and two clonal Vγ1-8-Jγ1.1 and 2.1 rearrangements. While conventional cytogenetics showed a normal male karyotype, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) detected the deletion of chromosome 17p in 22 of 200 interphases with deletion of TP53 gene. Immunohistochemistry of both trephine biopsy () and skin histology revealed infiltrations with Sézary cells (). The skin histology also confirmed CD30 positivity with 5-10%, and the diagnosis was revised to SS.The diagnosis was thus revised to Sézary Syndrome in Stage IVA (pT4 Nx M0 B2) according to the updated classification of International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL) and the European Organization of Research and Treatment (EORTC) ().Subsequently, successive therapies with 3,000,000 IU interferon alpha three times weekly for 6 months, combined with 10 mg/m2 methotrexate (MTX) and 19 courses ECP including bexarotene showed no improvement.Six months prior to alloHSCT an antibody-conjugate treatment with brentuximab vedotin (BV) was administered. The patient received five courses, which led to an improvement of skin lesions and their reduction to about 30% of body surface. CT scans showed no further progression of the lymph nodes, the CD4:CD8 ratio was 76.7 with 63.5% Sézary cells in the flow-cytometry, confirming stable disease according to the EORTC and ISCL classification (, ).Due to preexisting comorbidities, we performed an alloHSCT from an unrelated HLA identical (10/10) and cytomegaly virus matched (recipient and donor IgG positive) 30 year old male donor with non-myeloablative conditioning (fludarabine 30 mg/m² body surface area on d-4 to -2 and total body irradiation with 2 Gy on day -1) followed by infusion of pb stem cells (). Immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine A from d-1 (blood target level 200 ng/ml) and mycophenolate mofetil (3x1000 mg per day). The patient received a total of 6.6x106 CD34+ cells/kg body weight, 1.1x108 CD3+ cells/kg body weight and 0.2x108 CD16+ cells/kg body weight. In the absence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), mycophenolate-mofetil was tapered 500 mg every 14 days from day 40 and discontinued on day 74 while cyclosporine A was tapered from day +56 and discontinued on d+196.The restaging on day +30 and +90 after alloHSCT showed residual infiltration of SS cells in the FACS analysis of the bone marrow (13 and 5% of all WBC, respectively) and chimerism of 70 and 93% on sorted CD3+ cells. The CT scan on day +90 after alloHSCT confirmed the persistent lymphadenopathy. On day + 172 after alloHCT a complete hematological remission (CR) with no infiltration of SS in bone marrow trephine biopsy, 100% chimerism on sorted CD3 positive cells from bone marrow aspirate and normal pb CD4:CD 8 ratio was documented, thus confirming graft-vs-Sézary effect (). The CT scan showed no lymph node enlargements. The inspection of the skin revealed no suspect lesions.After discontinuation of immunosuppression the patient developed chronic GvHD of the ocular mucosa and the liver according to national institutes of health (NIH) criteria () on day 277 and required immunosuppressive treatment with intermediate dosage of methylprednisolone, cyclosporine A and mycophenolic acid. The immunosuppression could have been slowly tapered to 720 mg mycophenolic acid b.i.d, 5 mg prednisolone and autologous plasma eye drops as previously described (, ).

The patient reported that the vision loss began during a fishing trip when he became dehydrated and had not resolved. He described three to four similar events that occurred previously following episodes of extreme physical activity, however, all resolving. On presentation in 2016, visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. No fundus abnormalities were noted.

225,"A 64-year-old Caucasian male smoker with a horseshoe kidney with a history of open pyelolithotomy 18 years ago, presented to King Abdulaziz Medical City in mid-2020 with a report from another hospital stating that he developed gross hematuria six months prior, which was treated as a urinary tract infection. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed in that hospital, showing a horseshoe kidney with severe left hydronephrosis and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, with the largest one located in the posterior part of the left renal artery measuring 4.7 × 3.5 × 2.6 cm. Additionally, there were multiple stones (Figures , , ). Urine culture was performed and revealed that various organisms were isolated (10-100,000 CFU/ml). Urinalysis showed a small amount of blood with a moderate presence of leukocytes and a trace protein.At the end of 2020, the patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI showed a horseshoe kidney with chronic hydronephrosis of the left kidney and a large mass within it centrally with further satellite lesions, which all likely represent UC and associated lymphadenopathy along the para-aortic chain (Figure ). Additionally, a finding of chronic pancreatitis was noted with dilated duct and stone, for which the patient was referred to the gastroenterology department. Furthermore, a bone scan and chest CT were performed, and no significant abnormality or metastasis was found.After a couple of days, the patient presented to the emergency department with non-radiating progressive lower abdominal and left colicky flank pain for three days with hematuria and constipation with fullness. The patient denied any history of fever or vomiting. There were no other genitourinary symptoms, scrotal pain, or change in the level of consciousness. Vital signs were measured and were as follows: blood pressure, 151/71 mmHg; heart rate, 109; respiratory rate, 20; and temperature, 37.1℃. The weight of the patient was 48.4 kg, and height was 166 cm. The chest was clear, while the abdomen was tender over the left side and the left flank area. Lab results were obtained (Table ). Urine culture was performed and showed more than 100,000 CFU/ml of Staphylococcus aureus being isolated. Abdomen and pelvis CT was performed to rule out any intra-abdominal collections, but it was negative. The urology team was consulted for his chief complaint, as his case is already known to them. On examination, they found that the abdomen was soft with lower left quadrant tenderness. They concluded that the pain was less likely to be from the left kidney as the CT findings were stable. Furthermore, based on the urine culture result, the patient was prescribed Bactrim and was given an appointment for admission a week later to perform a flexible ureteroscopy with biopsy.After one week, the patient underwent ureteroscopy with cytology and culture based on his MRI findings. Cystoscopy and retrograde pyelography showed normal bilateral ureters. However, the left kidney was severely dilated, and cloudy urine was noticed from the left ureteric orifice. Thus, culture and cytology were taken; then, a double-J (DJ) stent was inserted (Figure ). Urine culture was positive for S. aureus, and the patient was already on Bactrim. The urine cytology result was negative for high-grade UC, but benign urothelial cells, squamous cells, inflammatory cells, and red blood cells were present. Furthermore, since cancer could not be excluded, the patient was discharged and given an appointment for a left nephroureterectomy.After two weeks, the patient presented to the emergency room complaining of left flank pain for five days with hematuria and constipation. The urology team was again consulted and suspected urinary tract infection at the site of the double J stent. Thus, the patient was admitted, given antibiotics, and was planned for the open left radical nephroureterectomy the following day. The surgery was successfully performed, and samples were sent to the histopathology department.Macroscopic examination showed a fairly-circumscribed, bulging, gray-white mass located mainly in the renal pelvis and mostly replacing the entire kidney. It measured 14 cm in maximum dimension. The mass cut sections were homogenous with areas of necrosis, with a stent present (Figure ). The mass is away from margins and Gerota’s fascia by 2 cm. The remaining kidney parenchyma showed dilated cystic spaces containing multiple brownstones. Furthermore, the resected left renal hilum lymph node measured 7 cm in maximum dimension. Microscopically, the tumor showed urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis with dysplasia in the background. In addition, the tumor had a predominance of sarcomatoid differentiation. Furthermore, foci of squamous formation containing keratin formation, and other foci of glands with mucinous and goblet cells lining were seen. The tumor was focally extending to the perinephric fat. Margins were negative; however, the ureteric margin showed dysplasia. The left renal hilum lymph node was positive for metastatic carcinoma. The final diagnosis based on the examination was UC of the renal pelvis with sarcomatoid differentiation (70%) and unusual histological differentiation including squamous (25%), and glandular (<5%) (Figure ). In addition, there was no outside pathology confirmation done. Immunohistochemistry profile was positive for CK7, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), vimentin, and focally for smooth muscle antigen (SMA). However, it was negative for desmin, cytokeratin (AE1/3), and GATA-3 (Figure ).According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), the pathological stage is pT3N2Mx. After a couple of days, the patient underwent a cystourethrogram, and there was no leak. The patient was eventually discharged in good health the next day and was given an appointment. The plan of the oncology team was to start adjuvant chemotherapy and perform positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) for the suspicious distant lymphadenopathy. In addition, CT, cystoscopy, and urine cytology were supposed to be done regularly.

240,"A 71-year-old African American female with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, and osteoarthritis initially presented to the emergency room with intermittent bilateral hand tingling and numbness, which was gradual in onset over months. Her symptoms were associated with seeing red spots and experiencing a burning sensation in the bottom of her feet. She was concerned because she was having difficulty picking up objects due to her hand symptoms. Her basic lab work was unremarkable, and she was provided gabapentin and magnesium oxide with close follow-up with her primary care physician. At follow-up, she complained of one to two months of unsteady gait as well as increased confusion. Her reported medications included losartan and metformin. Physical exam revealed normal pupils with reaction and accommodation (3mm diameter bilaterally), no cranial nerve deficits, normal strength throughout, and normal reflexes throughout except for diminished reflexes in the bilateral knees and ankles. She endorsed blurry vision; no ophthalmologic exam was performed, but she was able to read a name badge from one foot away. She additionally was found to have decreased vibratory and proprioception in a stocking pattern as well as a wide-based and unsteady gait.To investigate further, tests for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), folate, B12, and rapid plasma regain (RPR) titer were ordered. Her TSH, folate, and B12 levels were within normal limits, but her RPR titer was reactive at 1:1. A subsequent reflex Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) test was reactive. She was told to go to the hospital for further workup and treatment. Further questioning revealed that she had had two sexual partners in her life, both ex-husbands. However, she noted that her husbands committed adultery several times and that she was not currently sexually active; her last sexual encounter occurred several years ago. She endorsed that she did not notice any ulcers or skin lesions, and she had not been treated for syphilis. During hospitalization, she received a lumbar puncture that revealed a negative venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test result. Her glucose level (61 mg/dL) and white blood cell level (3 x 109/L) were normal, but her CSF protein level was markedly elevated at 156 mg/dL. Due to her exposure history, a constellation of symptoms, RPR titer with positive TP-PA, and protein elevation in her CSF, our infectious disease colleagues believed that she contracted syphilis earlier in life from one of her husbands and was never treated. The decision was made to start treatment with intravenous (IV) penicillin (24 million units, continuous infusion) for two weeks. At follow-up, her vision had improved and she no longer had sensory symptoms in her hands. Her gait was somewhat improved, but still unsteady, and she still had burning pain in her feet.

Repeat blood gas and labs revealed a worsening metabolic and lactic acidosis with a repeat pH of 6.7 and a lactic acid of 15.9. The patient was started on hemodialysis with a high bicarbonate dialysate for emergent clearance of hyperkalemia and refractory acidosis. After hemodialysis, the patient’s pH was 7.1, despite a worsening lactic acidosis of 17.0 mmol/L. Overnight the patient was converted to continuous venous-venous hemodialysis, a form of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Within 24 hours the patient’s acidemia corrected and blood pressure stabilized allowing for a de-escalation of vasopressors.

Due to concern for multifocal disease, MRI breast with without contrast was done and it showed 2.3 x 1.1 x 2.7 cm irregular-shaped, heterogeneous mass with irregular margins in the upper outer quadrant of right breast, 7 cm from the nipple, 1.2 cm from the skin and there was an additional mass measuring 8 mm x 4 mm x 1.6 cm at 12:00 along with 4 mm lesion, 7 mm from the nipple at 10:00 (Figures (a) and (b)). Right breast biopsy from the dominant lesion showed invasive mammary carcinoma with features of both lobular and ductal carcinoma, Nottingham histological grade 2, estrogen receptor 90%, progesterone receptor 100%, HER2 2+ by IHC but negative by FISH, Ki-67 50%.Status post right breast simple mastectomy and axillary lymph node evaluation. Surgical pathology showed a multifocal invasive mammary carcinoma of the breast with ductal and lobular features, size of largest invasive carcinoma was 55 mm, size of additional invasive foci was 1.5 mm, Nottingham histological grade 2 of 3, low to intermediate nuclear grade DCIS without central necrosis measuring at least 6 mm, margins uninvolved, one benign sentinel lymph node. Pathological staging (m)pT3 (sn)N0. Oncotype DX breast recurrence score of 16 (for patients <50 years of age, benefit from chemotherapy 1.6%). Genetic testing did not reveal any clinically significant mutations. The patient has received adjuvant PMRT 5000 cGy dose, 25 fractions along with 1000 cGy scar boost. Based on TEXT/SOFT data ovarian suppression could be considered in patients with high-risk features. The patient's tumor was multifocal, and the largest lesion measured 5.5 cm. The patient elected against surgical menopause. The patient was started on ovarian suppression with goserelin 3.6 mg every 28 days along with letrozole 2.5 mg once daily.Sixteen months after initiation of ovarian suppression patient started having a regular menstrual cycle while on goserelin. No medication interaction or missed doses were noted. The patient's BMI was 41.1 and BSA was 2.19 m2. Estradiol was 92 pg/mL and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was 4.3 mIU/mL in the premenopausal range. Few prior case reports showing failure of goserelin ovarian ablation in a premenopausal woman were reported. Given high-risk disease, discussed benefit of continued ovarian suppression plus AIs versus tamoxifen alone, and discussed the role of oophorectomy which results are reliable and prompt reduction in circulating estrogens. The patient was hesitant and wished to wait before the oophorectomy.

The patient was on ferrous fumarate, fexofenadine, fluoxetine, ibuprofen, lansoprazole, quetiapine, supplemental vitamins, regular morphine (modified release), and gabapentin.On admission, her blood pressure was 106/85 mmHg, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/minute, heart rate was 64 beats/minute, temperature was 35.1 °C, and capillary blood glucose was 6 mmol/L. Her weight on admission was 37.3 kg (body mass index [BMI] = 12.6). On examination, she was clearly malnourished, cachexic, and dehydrated. The rest of the clinical examination was normal, as shown in Table . Her chest radiograph showed patchy consolidations in the right middle and lower lobes (Figure ). She was prescribed appropriate antibiotics. She was refusing treatment and was deemed to lack the capacity to make that decision. Therefore, Section 5(2) under the Mental Health Act was put in place. She was commenced on oral supplements as per guidance from the dietitian, and then switched to nasogastric feeding.On the night of the second day, she had an episode of decreased consciousness, bradypnoea (RR-6), and hypotension (83/64). Her blood sugar level was 6.6 mmol/L. After receiving Naloxone, her symptoms improved, and her opiates were discontinued. The following day she mentioned right upper quadrant pain. Blood tests showed worsening liver enzymes, as shown in Table . An abdominal ultrasound was performed on the fourth day of admission, which showed multiple small calculi and biliary debris, with gallbladder oedema, and a small amount of peri-cholecystic fluid (Figure ).She was treated for cholecystitis with amoxicillin, clavulanic acid, and clarithromycin, which led to improvement in her inflammatory markers in the following days. She underwent an inpatient magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to rule out intra-biliary pathology, which was negative. Subsequently, she was referred to surgeons for consideration of elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy once deemed fit.She had a protracted and difficult admission. Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, her transfer to an Eating Disorders Unit proved difficult. By the fourth week of admission, her liver enzymes had improved, as can be seen in Table . Nasogastric feeding was successfully weaned as her weight improved.

Despite his critical condition, he managed to perform guided physical therapy exercises, including deep-breathing and achieving a 135° prone position. This intervention significantly improved his oxygen saturation, ultimately avoiding the need for intubation. After three days of rigorous physical therapy and oxygen therapy, he was shifted to the general ward for further rehabilitation.Which set of interventions were effectively utilized in managing this patient's acute respiratory distress?","{'A': 'use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (', 'B': 'guided physical therapy, deep-breathing exercises, and achieving a 135° prone position', 'C': 'administration of antiviral drugs', 'D': 'mechanical ventilation', 'E': 'corticosteroid therapy.'}","guided physical therapy, deep-breathing exercises, and achieving a 135° prone position",B
330,"One week after a positive COVID-19 result this 57-year-old male was admitted to the ICU because of oxygen desaturation (70%) with worsening tachypnea and dyspnea. Physical therapy started immediately after ICU admission. We found a highly dyspneic patient with a high breathing frequency and significant symptom exacerbation from the slightest effort. With hands-on physical therapy guidance, the patient managed to achieve a 135° prone position and to perform deep-breathing exercises resulting in an increase in oxygen saturation from 88% to 96%. Intensive physical therapy and positioning was continued along with 6 to 12 L/min of oxygen therapy over the next days and intubation was avoided. The major challenges in achieving a prone position were the patient’s profoundly reduced respiratory capacity and the high risk of exacerbating his symptoms. However, standard ICU monitoring enabled safe implementation at an individually adapted pace to allow sufficient time for convalescence. After 3 days with this regime, he could be transferred to the normal ward, where physical therapists carried on his rehabilitation with walking and strength training. The patient’s severe instability remained a challenge.

At presentation an erythroderma involving >90% of the integument was predominant (). Computer tomography (CT) scans showed enlarged axillary, inguinal and cervical lymph nodes. The complete blood counts showed a leukocytosis of 24,300/µl. Flow cytometry of the pb revealed 11,664 Sézary cells/µl with CD4+CD7- phenotype and with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 85.5. Flow cytometry of the bone marrow aspirate confirmed CD30 positivity with expression of 7% in Sézary cells.

372,"An 84-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension presented with weakness, dry cough, and shortness of breath for four days. The patient had received two doses of the COVID vaccine, with the second dose in March 2021. In the ER, her vital signs were BP 133/93, HR 103 bpm, RR 22 breaths/min, oxygen saturation of 96% on 40 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula, and afebrile. Laboratory assessment is in Table. Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive. Chest X-ray on admission shows worsening right pleural effusion with new opacity obscuring the lower two-third of the right lung and a new pleural-based opacity in the left upper lobe Figure. CT chest with contrast shows large right pleural effusion and associated right basilar consolidation and abdominal ascites. The patient was admitted to the telemetry unit and started on methylprednisolone, piperacillin-tazobactam, remdesivir, and baricitinib. The patient clinically deteriorated on Day 2 and was transferred to the intensive care unit for thoracentesis and possible intubation. Thoracentesis removed 1.95 L of bloody, serosanguineous fluid obtained, with partial resolution of the effusion Figure. On Day 3, the patient developed septic shock, florid renal failure, and lethargy and was started on intravenous fluids and norepinephrine drip. Chest X-ray showed near-complete opacification of bilateral lung fields and subsequently was intubated. On Day 4, tense ascites were noted and the patient underwent paracentesis, which removed 4.25 L of bloody, serosanguinous fluid. Renal replacement therapy started. The patient was deemed to have a guarded prognosis with multiorgan failure.",sepsis,current/short-term management,"An 84-year-old woman with hypertension was admitted to the hospital with respiratory symptoms and a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Despite initial treatment, her condition worsened. She developed a pleural effusion and was transferred to the ICU. Despite undergoing thoracentesis, her condition continued to deteriorate.Given the patient's worsening condition and the development of complications, what is the appropriate immediate clinical intervention?","{'A': 'deferring antibiotic treatment until culture results are available', 'B': 'initiation of immunosuppressive therapy', 'C': 'starting anticoagulation therapy without addressing septic shock.', 'D': 'withholding current medications and starting supportive care only', 'E': 'initiation of palliative care only', 'F': 'the immediate intervention should include aggressive fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy, initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics to combat septic shock, continuation of covid-19 specific treatment, and supportive care for multiorgan failure.'}","the immediate intervention should include aggressive fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy, initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics to combat septic shock, continuation of covid-19 specific treatment, and supportive care for multiorgan failure.",F
